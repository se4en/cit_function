Here, we propose\nto use asares in a quite similar way to retrieve\nour valid N-V pairs. However, the N-V combi-\nnations sought are more specific than those that\nwere identified in these previous experiments.\nFormally, ILP aims at inferring logic pro-\ngrams (sets of Horn clauses, notedH) from a set\nof facts (examples and counter-examples of the\nconcept to be learnt) and background knowledge\n(B), such that the program H logically entails\nthe examples with respect to the background\nknowledge and rejects (most of) the counter-\nexamples. This is transcribed by the two logical\nformulae B ?H |= E+, B ?H 6|= E?, which set\nthe aim of an ILP algorithm.\nIn this framework, asares infers clauses ex-\npressing morpho-syntactic patterns that gener-\nalize the structures of sentences containing the\ntarget element (examples) but not the structures\nof the sentences containing counter-examples.\nThe background knowledge encodes information\nabout each word occurring in the example or\ncounter-example, namely the meaning of its tag\n(e.g., adjective in plural form, infinitive verb).\nThe main benefits of this acquisition tech-\nnique lie in the inferred patterns.

In\nour case, E+ must thus be composed of (POS-\ntagged) sentences containing valid N-V pairs;\nconversely, E? must be composed of sentences\ncontaining non-valid N-V pairs. While this step\nis tedious and usually carried out manually, the\noriginality of our work lies in the fact that E+\nand E? are obtained automatically.\nTo produce the positive examples, we use the\nexisting entries of a terminological database we\nare currently developing. These entries are thus\na kind of bootstrap in our acquisition process.\nMore precisely, every N-V pair in which V is de-\nfined in the database as a realization verb for N\nis included.

Note that we do not\ncheck if each occurrence of the N-V pair actually\nshares the target semantic link or even a syn-\ntactic link in the sentences that are extracted.\nSome of the examples in E+ might be incorrect,\nbut asares tolerates a certain amount of noise.\nA totally different technique is needed to pro-\nduce the E? set, since no information concern-\ning verbs that are not semantically related is\navailable in the terminological database. To ob-\ntain a list of invalid N-V pairs, we acquire them\nfrom our corpus using a statistical technique.\nThis produces a list of all N-V pairs that ap-\npear in the same sentence, and assigns each a\nscore.

For\nexample, the inferred Horn clause:\nrealization(N,V) :- common_noun(N), contigu-\nous(N,V), N 6=V. transcribes the fact that a noun\nand a verb may be a valid N-V pair if N is\na common noun (common_noun(N)) and V is\ncontiguous to N (contiguous(N,V). (Determiners\nare not taken into account.) This pattern\ncovers the case in which N precedes V, such as\n les utilisateurs lancent tour-?-tour leurs programmes\n(users launch in turn their programs) or\nin which V precedes N, such as  il est donc\nn?cessaire d'ex?cuter la commande depmod  (thus,\nit is necessary to run the depmod command .\nA quite similar clue is given in the following\npattern:\nrealization(N,V) :- near_verb(N,V), suc(V,C),\nsuc(C,N), noun(N), V 6=C, N 6=C, N 6=V. The\nnear_verb(N,V) predicate means that no verb\noccurs between N and V, and suc(X,Y) that\nthe word X is followed by Y. This clause can\nbe expressed in a more classical way as V +\n(anything but a verb) + N and retrieves pairs like\nC'est un service qui vous permet de vous connecter\n? Internet (This is a service that allows you to\nconnect to the Internet).\nAnother frequent clue in the patterns pro-\nduced is, unsurprisingly, that N must be the\nhead of a noun phrase. For example, realiza-\ntion(N,V) :- near_word(N,V), near_verb(N,V), pre-\ncedes(V,N), noun_ph_head(N), pred(N,C), preposi-\ntion(C), V 6=C, N 6=C, N 6=V.

Even if this kind of error does\nnot come directly from our acquisition technique\nand does not call into question our approach, it\nis still a factor that should be taken into ac-\ncount, especially when considering the choice of\nCompuTerm 2004 - 3rd International Workshop on Computational Terminology44\nthe tagger and the quality of the texts compos-\ning our corpus.\nSecondly, in a few cases, there is no syn-\ntactic link between N and V, as is the\ncase with logiciel-garantir (software-guarantee) in\ncette phase garantit la v?rification du logiciel (this\nstep guarantees the software verification). Even\nif these errors are rare in the retrieved pairs ex-\namined, our symbolic extraction system could\ncertainly be enhanced with information about\nthe syntactic function of nouns (subject, direct\nobject...). The learning algorithm could then\nincorporate this information and produce more\nrelevant patterns.\nThirdly, some N-V pairs are retrieved, al-\nthough there is no semantic link between N and\nV, or at least, not a semantic link that would\nbe encoded by a terminographer in a dictionary.\nThis is the case for ordinateur-savoir (computer-\nknow) in  l'ordinateur ne sait pas o? chercher (the\ncomputer does not know where to look ). Again,\nmorpho-syntactic information is not always suf-\nficient to distinguish between semantically re-\nlated pairs and non-semantically (but syntacti-\ncally) related ones.\nFinally, other very frequent errors are caused\nby the fact that there actually is an interesting\nsemantic link between N and V in a retrieved\npair, but not the realization link we are looking\nfor. Indeed, some nouns belonging to specific\nsemantic classes will often cooccur with verbs\nexpressing realization meanings (and thus often\nappear in valid N-V pairs) while others do not.\nFor example, nouns like ordinateur (computer)\nand utilisateur (user) often appear in valid N-V\npairs. On the other hand, other nouns clearly\ndo not appear in combinations with realization\nverbs (e.g., configuration; Internet, refer to Table\n3).\nThese last two kinds of error clearly illustrate\nthe limitations of our symbolic approach (but\nare also very frequent errors in statistical ap-\nproaches since cooccurrence is not enough to\ncapture subtle semantic distinctions). In fact,\nthey tend to show that our method could be\nenhanced if it could incorporate richer linguis-\ntic information. Indeed, morpho-syntactic infor-\nmation is not always sufficient to operate fine-\ngrained sense distinctions. For example, the\ntwo sentences below have the same combina-\ntion of Part-of-Speech tags: vous pouvez utiliser la\ncommande exit (you can use the exit command)\nand vous devez choisir l'option 64MB (you must\nchoose the 64MB option); in the first one the\nunderlined N-V pair is valid whereas this is not\nthe case in the second one. Realization verbs\nfor option would be valider (validate) and activer\n(activate), for example.

In addition to its explanatory capacity, this symbolic acquisition technique has obtained good results for other acquisition tasks when compared to existing statistical techniques (Bouillon et al, 2002). 4.3 Acquisition process To infer extraction patterns, asares needs a set of examples (E+) and a set of counter-examples (E?) of the elements we want to retrieve. In our case, E+ must thus be composed of (POStagged) sentences containing valid N-V pairs; conversely, E? must be composed of sentences containing non-valid N-V pairs. While this step is tedious and usually carried out manually, the originality of our work lies in the fact that E+ and E? are obtained automatically.

This approach, which uses words that appear in the context of terms to formulate hypotheses on their semantic relatedness (Habert et al, 1996, for example), does not specify the relationship itself. Hence, synonyms, co-hyponyms, hyperonyms, etc. are not differentiated. More recent work on terminology structuring has focussed on formal similarity to develop hypotheses on the semantic relationships between terms: Daille (2003) uses derivational morphology; Grabar and Zweigenbaum (2002) use, as a starting point, a number of identical characters. Up to now, the focus has been on nouns and adjectives, since these structuring methods have been applied to lists of extracted candidate terms (Habert et al, 1996; Daille, 2003) or to lists of admitted terms (Grabar and Zweigenbaum, 2002).

Moreover, the inferred patterns yield interesting clues on which structures are more likely to convey the target semantic link. 1 Introduction Recent literature in computational terminology has shown an increasing interest in identifying various semantic relationships between terms. Different strategies have been developed in order to identify pairs of terms that share a specific semantic relationship (such as hyperonymy or meronymy) or to build classes of terms. However, most strategies are based on internal or external methods (Grabar and Zweigenbaum, 2002), i.e. methods that rely on the form of terms or on the information gathered from contexts. (In some cases, an additional resource, such as a dictionary or a thesaurus, is used during the identification process.)

Asares is presented in detail in (Claveau et al, 2003). We simply give a short account of its basic principles herein. Asares is based on a Machine Learning technique, Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) (Muggleton and De-Raedt, 1994), which infers general morpho-syntactic patterns from a set of examples (this set is noted E+ hereafter) and counter-examples (E?) of the elements one 2 Cordial is a commercial product of SynapseD?veloppement.

The background knowledge encodes information about each word occurring in the example or counter-example, namely the meaning of its tag (e.g., adjective in plural form, infinitive verb). The main benefits of this acquisition technique lie in the inferred patterns. Indeed, contrary to the more classical statistical methods (Mutual Information, Loglike..., see below) used for collocation acquisition (see (Pearce, 2002) for a review), these patterns allow: 1. understanding of the results, that is, why a specific element has been retrieved or not; 2. highlighting of the corpus-specific structures conveying the target element. In addition to its explanatory capacity, this symbolic acquisition technique has obtained good results for other acquisition tasks when compared to existing statistical techniques (Bouillon et al, 2002). 4.3 Acquisition process To infer extraction patterns, asares needs a set of examples (E+) and a set of counter-examples (E?) of the elements we want to retrieve.

Here, we propose to use asares in a quite similar way to retrieve our valid N-V pairs. However, the N-V combinations sought are more specific than those that were identified in these previous experiments. Formally, ILP aims at inferring logic programs (sets of Horn clauses, notedH) from a set of facts (examples and counter-examples of the concept to be learnt) and background knowledge (B), such that the program H logically entails the examples with respect to the background knowledge and rejects (most of) the counterexamples.
