We also add versions with target words mapped to classes. 3.4 Differences from Previous Work Our backend innovations support the UI and enable feature-based learning from human corrections. In contrast, most previous work on incremental MT learning has focused on extracting new translation rules, language model updating, and modifying translation model probabilities (see: Denkowski et al. (2014a)). We regard these features as additive to our own work: certainly extracting new, unseen rules should help translation in a new domain. Moreover, to our knowledge, all previous work on updating the weight vector w has considered simulated post-editing, in which the independent references e are substituted for corrections h.

Conversely, systems tuned to edit-distance-based metrics like TER tend to produce short translations that are heavily penalized by other metrics. When human corrections become available, we switch to HTER, which correlates with human judgment and is an interpretable measure of editing effort. Whereas TER is computed as TER(e, ˆe), HTER is HTER(h, ˆe). HBLEU is an alternative, but since BLEU is invariant to some permutations (Callison-Burch et al., 2006), it is less interpretable. We find that it also does not work as well in practice. We previously proposed a fast, online tuning algorithm (Green et al., 2013b) based on AdaGrad (Duchi et al., 2011). The default loss function is expected error (EE) (Och, 2003; Cherry and Foster, 2012). Expected BLEU is an example of EE, which we found to be unstable when switching metrics. This may result from direct incorporation of the error metric into the gradient computation. To solve this problem, we propose a crossentropy loss which, to our knowledge, is new in MT. Let Eˆ = {ˆei}ni=1 be an n-best list ranked by a gold metric G(e, ˆe) > 0. Assume we have a preference of a higher G (e.g., BLEU or 1−HTER).

The post-edit baseline is lower because humans performed less editing in the baseline condition (see Table 1). Features account for the greatest reduction in HTER. Of course, the features are based mostly on word alignments, which could be obtained for the post-edit data by running an online word alignment tool (see: Farajian et al. (2014)). However, the interactive logs contain much richer user state information that we could not exploit due to data sparsity. We also hypothesize that the final interactive corrections might be more useful since suggestions prime translators (Green et al., 2013a), and the MT system was able to refine its suggestions. 6 Re-tuning Analysis Tables 6 and 7 raise two natural questions: what accounts for the reduction in HTER, and why are the TER/BLEU results mixed? Comparison of the BLEU-tuned baseline to the HTER re-tuned systems gives some insight. For both questions, fine1233 grained corrections appear to make the difference.

We designed a new user interface (UI) for the experiment. The interface places demands on the MT backend\u2014not the other way around. The most significant new MT system features are prefix decoding, for translation completion based on a user prefix; and dynamic phrase table augmentation, to handle target out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. Discriminative re-tuning is accomplished with a novel cross-entropy objective function. We report three main findings: (1) post-editing is faster than interactive MT, corroborating Koehn (2009a); (2) interactive MT yields higher quality translation when baseline MT quality is high; and (3) re-tuning to interactive feedback leads to larger held-out HTER gains relative to post-edit. Together these results show that a human-centered approach to computer aided translation (CAT) may involve tradeoffs between human effort and machine learnability.
