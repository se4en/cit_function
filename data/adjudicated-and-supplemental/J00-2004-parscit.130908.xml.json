Most of these algorithms can be summarized as follows: 1. Choose a similarity function S between word types in Li and word types in L. 2. Compute association scores S(u, v) for a set of word type pairs (u, v) E (Li x Â£2) that occur in training data. 3. Sort the word pairs in descending order of their association scores. 4. Discard all word pairs for which S(u, v) is less than a chosen threshold. The remaining word pairs become the entries in the translation lexicon. The various proposals differ mainly in their choice of similarity function.

Method B exploits this property under the hypothesis that &quot;one sense per collocation&quot; holds for translational collocations. This hypothesis implies that if u and v are possible mutual translations, and a token u co-occurs with a token v in the bitext, then with very high probability the pair (u, v) was generated from the same concept and should be linked.
