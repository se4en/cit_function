Using V-Measure along with several other evaluation measures, we compare the performance of the different induction systems on both WSJ (the data on which most systems were developed and tested) and Multext East, a corpus of parallel texts in eight different languages. We find that for virtually all measures and datasets, older systems using relatively simple models and algorithms (Brown et al., 1992; Clark, 2003) work as well or better than systems using newer and often far more sophisticated and time-consuming machine learning methods (Goldwater and Griffiths, 2007; Johnson, 2007; Graca et al., 2009; Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2010). Thus, although these newer methods have introduced potentially useful machine learning techniques, they should not be assumed to provide the best performance for unsupervised POS induction. In addition to our review and comparison, we introduce a new way to both evaluate and potentially improve a POS induction system.

Each system outputs a set of syntactic clusters C; except where noted, the target number of clusters |C |must be specified as an input parameter. Since we are interested in out-of-the-box performance, we use the default parameter settings for each system, except for |C|, which is varied in some of our experiments. The systems are as follows:1 [brown]: Class-based n-grams (Brown et al., 1992). This is the oldest and one of the simplest systems we tested. It uses a bigram model where each word type is assigned to a latent class (a hard assignment), and the probability of the corpus w1 ... wn is computed as P(w1|c1) ∏n i=2 P(wi|ci)P(ci|ci−1), where ci is the class of wi. The goal is to optimize the probability of the corpus under this model. The authors use an approximate search procedure: greedy agglomerative hierarchical clustering followed by a step in which individual word types are considered for movement to a different class if this improves the corpus probability.

Since portability is a distinguishing feature for unsupervised models, we have stressed the importance of testing the systems on corpora that were not used in their development, and especially on different languages. We found that on non-English languages, Clark\u2019s (2003) system performed best. Finally, we introduced the idea of evaluating induction systems based on their ability to produce useful cluster prototypes. We found that the oldest system (Brown et al., 1992) yielded the best prototypes, and that using these prototypes gave state-of-the-art performance on WSJ, as well as improvements on nearly all of the non-English corpora. These promising results suggest a new direction for future research: improving POS induction by developing methods targeted towards extracting better prototypes, rather than focusing on improving clustering of the entire data set.
