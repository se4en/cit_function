Another finding was that the candidates\u2019 power correlates with the distribution of topics they speak about in the debates: candidates with more power spoke significantly more about certain topics (e.g., economy) and less about certain other topics (e.g., energy). However, these findings relate to the specific election cycle that was analyzed and will not carry over to political debates in general. A further dimension with relevance beyond a specific election campaign is how topics evolve during the course of an interaction (e.g., who attempts to shift topics). In (Prabhakaran et al., 2014), we explored this dimension and found that candidates with higher power introduce significantly more topics in the debates, but attempt to shift topics significantly less often while responding to a moderator. We used the basic LDA topic modeling method (with a filter for substantivity of turns) to assign topics to turns, which were then used to detect shifts in topics. However, segmenting interactions into coherent topic segments is an active area of research and a variety of topic modeling approaches have been proposed for that purpose.

We also find that this fluctuation in topic shifting tendencies is significantly correlated with the candidates\u2019 power. As an additional contribution of this paper, we demonstrate the utility of our topic shift features extracted using both types of SITS-based analyses in improving the performance of the automatic power ranker system presented in (Prabhakaran et al., 2013b). We also investigated the utility of topic shifting features described in (Prabhakaran et al., 2014) extracted using LDA based topic modeling. However, they did not improve the performance of the ranker, and hence we do not discuss them in detail in this paper. 3 Data We use the presidential debates corpus released by Prabhakaran et al. (2013a), which contains manual transcripts of 20 debates held between May 2011 and February 2012 as part of the 2012 Republican presidential primaries.

Table 1 shows the Pearson\u2019s product correlation between each topical feature and candidate\u2019s power. We obtain a highly significant (p = 0.002) negative correlation between topic shift tendency of a candidate (PI) and his/her power. In other words, the variation in the topic shifting tendencies is significantly correlated with the candidates\u2019 recent poll standings. Candidates who are higher up in the polls tend to stay on topic while the candidates with less power attempt to shift topics more often. This is in line with our previous findings from (Prabhakaran et al., 2014) that candidates with higher power attempt to shift topics less often than others when responding to moderators. It is also in line with the findings by Prabhakaran et al. (2013a) that candidates with higher power tend not to interrupt others. On the other hand, we did not obtain any significant correlation for the features proposed by Nguyen et al. (2013). 6 Topic Shift Features in Power Ranker In this section, we investigate the utility of the SITS and SITSvar based topic shift features described above in the problem of automatically ranking the participants of debates based on their power.
