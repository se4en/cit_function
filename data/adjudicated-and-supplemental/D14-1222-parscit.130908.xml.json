Poesio and Vieira (1998) and Bunescu (2003) include cases where antecedent and anaphor are coreferent but do not share the same head noun (different-head coreference). We follow our previous work (Hou et al., 2013b) and restrict bridging to non-coreferential cases. We also exclude comparative anaphora (Modjeska et al., 2003). Bridging resolution includes two subtasks: (1) recognizing bridging anaphors and (2) finding the correct antecedent among candidates. In recent empirical work, these two subtasks have been tackled separately: (Markert et al., 2012; Cahill and Riester, 2012; Rahman and Ng, 2012; Hou et al., 2013a) handle bridging recognition as part of information status (IS) classification, while (Poesio et al., 1997; Poesio et al., 2004; Markert et al., 2003; Lassalle and Denis, 2011; Hou et al.,","@endWordPosition":"351","@position":"2388","annotationId":"T38","@startWordPosition":"348","@citStr":"Hou et al., 2013"},{"#tail":"\n","#text":"ent over the rule-based system.
