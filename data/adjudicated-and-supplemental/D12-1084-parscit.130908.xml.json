It is hard to do a direct comparison with stateof-the-art paraphrase recognition systems, because most are evaluated on different corpora, e.g., the Microsoft paraphrase corpus (Dolan and Brockett, 2005, MSR).

While the MSR corpus is larger than our collection, the wording variations in its paraphrase pairs are usually lower than for our examples.

They are quite successful in NE-centered tasks, like information extraction, but their level of generalization or coverage is insufficient for applications like Recognizing Textual Entailment (Dinu and Wang, 2009). The research on general paraphrase fragment extraction at the sub-sentential level is mainly based 917 on phrase pair extraction techniques from the MT literature. Munteanu and Marcu (2006) extract subsentential translation pairs from comparable corpora using the log-likelihood-ratio of word translation probability. Quirk et al.

Our own work (Wang and Callison-Burch, 2011) extends the first idea to paraphrase fragment extraction on monolingual parallel and comparable corpora.

Our approach for sentential paraphrase extraction is related to the one introduced by Barzilay and Lee (2003), who also employ multiple sequence alignment (MSA). However, they use MSA at the sentence level rather than at the discourse level. We take some core ideas from our previous work on mining script information (Regneri et al., 2010). In this earlier work, we focused on event structures and their possible realizations in natural language. The corpus used in those experiments were short crowd-sourced descriptions of everyday tasks written in bullet point style. We aligned them with a hand-crafted similarity measure that was specifically designed for this text type. In this current work, we target the general task of extracting paraphrases for events rather than the much more specific scriptrelated task. The current approach uses a domainindependent similarity measure instead of a specific hand-crafted similarity score and ","@endWordPosition":"1042","@position":"6877","annotationId":"T17","@startWordPosition":"1039","@citStr":"Regneri et al., 2010"},{"#tail":"\n","#text":"entential paraphrase matching and paraphrase fragment extraction using manually labelled gold standards (provided in the supplementary material).

Our system beats an informed baseline by a margin of 50%. 1 Introduction It is widely agreed that identifying paraphrases is a core task for natural language processing, including applications like document summarization (Barzilay et al., 1999), Recognizing Textual Entailment (Dagan et al., 2005), natural language generation (Zhao et al., 2010; Ganitkevitch et al., 2011), and machine translation (Marton et al., 2009). As a consequence, many methods have been proposed for generating large paraphrase resources (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Szpektor et al., 2004; Dolan et al., 2004). One of the intuitively appropriate data sources for such collections are parallel or comparable corpora: if two texts are translations of the same foreign document, or if they describe the same underlying scenario, they should contain a reasonable number of sentence pairs that convey the same meaning. Most approaches that extract paraphrases from parallel texts employ some type of pattern matching: sentences with the same meaning are assumed to share many n-grams (Barzilay and Lee, 2003; Callison-Burch, 2008, among others), many words in their context (Barzilay and McKeo","@endWordPosition":"194","@position":"1401","annotationId":"T19","@startWordPosition":"191","@citStr":"Szpektor et al., 2004"}},"title":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"Scaling Web-based Acquisition of Entailment Relations."},"booktitle":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"In Proceedings of EMNLP"},"@valid":"true","authors":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"\n","author":[{"#tail":"\n","#text":"Idan Szpektor"},{"#tail":"\n","#text":"Hristo Tanev"},{"#tail":"\n","#text":"Ido Dagan"},{"#tail":"\n","#text":"Bonaventura Coppola"}]}},{"#tail":"\n","date":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"2011"},"rawString":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"Rui Wang and Chris Callison-Burch. 2011.

Both parallel corpora and comparable corpora have been quite well studied. Barzilay and McKeown (2001) use different English translations of the same novels (i.e., monolingual parallel corpora), while others (Quirk et al., 2004) experiment on multiple sources of the same news/events, i.e., monolingual comparable corpora. Commonly used (candidate) comparable corpora are news articles written by different news agencies within a limited time window (Wang and Callison-Burch, 2011). Other studies focus on extracting paraphrases from large bilingual parallel corpora, which the machine translation (MT) community provides in many varieties. Bannard and Callison-Burch (2005) as well as Zhao et al. (2008) take one language as the pivot and match two possible translations in the other languages as paraphrases if they share a common pivot phrase. As parallel corpora have many alternative ways of expressing the same foreign language concept, large quantities of paraphrase pairs can be extracted.

The research on general paraphrase fragment extraction at the sub-sentential level is mainly based 917 on phrase pair extraction techniques from the MT literature. Munteanu and Marcu (2006) extract subsentential translation pairs from comparable corpora using the log-likelihood-ratio of word translation probability. Quirk et al. (2007) extract fragments using a generative model of noisy translations. Our own work (Wang and Callison-Burch, 2011) extends the first idea to paraphrase fragment extraction on monolingual parallel and comparable corpora. Our current approach also uses word-word alignment, however, we use syntactic dependency trees to compute grammatical fragments. Our use of dependency trees is inspired by the constituent-tree-based experiments of Callison-Burch (2008). 3 Paraphrases and Discourse Previous approaches have shown that comparable texts provide a good basis for paraphrase extraction. We want to show that discourse structure is highly useful for precise and high-yield paraphrase collection from such corpora.

The resulting alignment can be further constrained by a modified longest common substring (LCS) algorithm, which takes sequences of 920 words instead of letters as input. Smoothing (step 2) is done for each word by taking the average score of it and its four neighbor words. All the word alignments (excluding stop-words) with positive scores are selected as candidate fragment elements. Provided with the candidate fragment elements, we previously (Wang and Callison-Burch, 2011) used a chunker3 to finalize the output fragments, in order to follow the linguistic definition of a (para-) phrase. We extend this step in the current system by applying a dependency parser to constrain the boundary of the fragments (Sec. 5.3). Finally, we filter out trivial fragment pairs, such as identical or the original sentence pairs. 5.3 VP-fragment Extraction To obtain more grammatical output fragments, we add another layer of linguistic information to our input sentences.

We use the VP-based fragment extraction system (VP), and compare the performances by using either the outputs from our main system (MSA+VP) or alternatively the baseline that replaces MSA with a clustering algorithm (CLUSTER+VP).
