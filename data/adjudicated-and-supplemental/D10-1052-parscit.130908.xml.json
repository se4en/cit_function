However, while translation models have evolved from word-based to syntax-based modeling, the de facto alignment model remains word-based (Brown et al., 1993; Vogel et al., 1996). This gap between alignment modeling and translation modeling is clearly undesirable as it often generates tensions that would prevent the extraction of many useful translation rules (DeNero and Klein, 2007). Recent work, e.g. by Blunsom et al. (2009) and Haghihi et al. (2009) just to name a few, show that alignment models that bear closer resemblance to state-of-theart translation model consistently yields not only a better alignment quality but also an improved translation quality. In this paper, we follow this recent effort to narrow the gap between alignment model and translation model to improve translation quality. More concretely, we focus on the reordering component since we observe that the treatment of reordering remains significantly different when comparing alignment versus translation: the reordering component in state-of-the-","@endWordPosition":"254","@position":"1811","annotationId":"T1","@startWordPosition":"251","@citStr":"Blunsom et al.

Because the frequency of function words is high, we find that by predicting the reordering of function words accurately, the reordering of the remaining words improves in accuracy as well. In total, we introduce six sub-models involving function words, and these serve as features in a log linear model. We train model weights discriminatively using Minimum Error Rate Training (MERT) (Och, 2003), optimizing F-measure. The parameters of our sub-models are estimated from manually-aligned corpora, leading the reordering model more directly toward reproducing human alignments, rather than maximizing the likelihood of unaligned training data. This use of manual data for parameter estimation is a reasonable choice because these models depend on a small, fixed number of lexical items that occur frequently in language, hence only small training corpora are required.

Since the IBM model is asymmetric, we followed the standard practice of running GIZA++ twice, once in each direction, and combining the resulting outputs heuristically.

We recorded the alignment quality of the test set as our baseline performance. For our alignment model, we used the same set of training data. To align the test set, we first tuned the weights of the features in our discriminative alignment model using minimum error rate training (MERT) (Och, 2003) with Fα=0.1 as the optimization criterion. At each iteration, our aligner outputs k-best alignments under current set of weights, from which MERT proceeds to compute the next set of weights. MERT terminates once the improvement over the previous iteration is lower than a predefined value. Once tuned, we ran our aligner on the test set and measured the quality of the resulting alignment as the performance of our model.

This leaves most alignment decisions to association-based scores. Why is employing stronger reordering models more challenging in alignment than in translation? One answer can be attributed to the fact that alignment points are unobserved in parallel text, thus so are their reorderings. As such, introducing stronger reordering often further exacerbates the computational complexity to do inference over the model. Some recent alignment models appeal to external linguistic knowledge, mostly by using monolingual syntactic parses (Cherry and Lin, 2006; Pauls et al., 2010), which at the same time, provides an approximation of the bilingual syntactic divergences that drive the reordering. To our knowledge, however, this approach has been used mainly to constrain reordering possibilities, or to add to the generalization ability of association-based scores, not to directly model reordering in the context of alignment. 534 Proceedings of the 2010 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 534\u2013544, MIT, Massachusetts, USA, 9-11 October 2010. c�2010 Association for Computational Linguistics In this paper, we introduce a new approach to impr","@endWordPosition":"459","@position":"3202","annotationId":"T10","@startWordPosition":"456","@citStr":"Pauls et al., 2010"},{"#tail":"\n","#text":"se distortion-based models remains widespread (Marcu and Wong, 2002; Moore, 2004).

Efforts to constrain the space generally comes from the use of Inversion Transduction Grammar (ITG) (Wu, 1997). Recent proposals that use ITG constraints include (Haghighi et al., 2009; Blunsom et al., 2009) just to name a few. More recent models have begun to use linguisticallymotivated constraints, often in combination with ITG, primarily exploiting monolingual syntactic information (Burkett et al., 2010; Pauls et al., 2010). Our reordering model is closely related to the model proposed by Zhang and Gildea (2005; 2006; 2007a), with respect to conditioning the reordering predictions on lexical items. These related models treat their lexical items as latent variables to be estimated from training data, while our model uses a fixed set of lexical items that correspond to the class of function words. With respect to the focus on function words, our reordering model is closely related to the UALIGN system (Hermjakob, 2009). However, UALIGN uses deep syntactic analysis and hand-crafted heuristics in its model. 542 9 Conclusions Languages exhibit regularities of word order that are preserved when projected ","@endWordPosition":"5662","@position":"34827","annotationId":"T16","@startWordPosition":"5659","@citStr":"Zhang and Gildea (2005"}},"title":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"Stochastic lexicalized inversion transduction grammar for alignment."},"booktitle":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"In ACL.
