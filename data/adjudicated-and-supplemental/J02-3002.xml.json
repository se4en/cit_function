When incorporated into a part-of-speech\ntagger, it helped reduce the error rate significantly on capitalized words and sentence boundaries.\nWe also investigated the portability to other languages and obtained encouraging results.\n"},{"#tail":"\n","@confidence":"0.958210535714286","#text":"\nDisambiguation of sentence boundaries and normalization of capitalized words, as\nwell as identification of abbreviations, however small in comparison to other tasks\nof text processing, are of primary importance in the developing of practical text-\nprocessing applications. These tasks are usually performed before actual ?intelligent?\ntext processing starts, and errors made at this stage are very likely to cause more errors\nat later stages and are therefore very dangerous.\nDisambiguation of capitalized words in mixed-case texts has received little atten-\ntion in the natural language processing and information retrieval communities, but in\nfact it plays an important role in many tasks. In mixed-case texts capitalized words\nusually denote proper names (names of organizations, locations, people, artifacts, etc.),\nbut there are special positions in the text where capitalization is expected. Such manda-\ntory positions include the first word in a sentence, words in titles with all significant\nwords capitalized or table entries, a capitalized word after a colon or open quote, and\nthe first word in a list entry, among others. Capitalized words in these and some other\npositions present a case of ambiguity: they can stand for proper names, as in White\nlater said . . . , or they can be just capitalized common words, as in White elephants are\n. . . . The disambiguation of capitalized words in ambiguous positions leads to the\nidentification of proper names (or their derivatives), and in this article we will use\nthese two terms and the term case normalization interchangeably.\nChurch (1995, p. 294) studied, among other simple text normalization techniques,\nthe effect of case normalization for different words and showed that ?sometimes case\nvariants refer to the same thing (hurricane and Hurricane), sometimes they refer to\ndifferent things (continental and Continental) and sometimes they don?t refer to much\nof anything (e.g., anytime and Anytime).? Obviously these differences arise because\nsome capitalized words stand for proper names (such as Continental, the name of an\nairline) and some do not.\n?

The main objective of this subtask is the identi-\nfication of proper names and also their classification into semantic categories (person,\norganization, location, etc.).1 There the disambiguation of the first word in a sentence\n(and in other ambiguous positions) is one of the central problems: about 20% of named\nentities occur in ambiguous positions. For instance, the word Black in the sentence-\ninitial position can stand for a person?s surname but can also refer to the color. Even\nin multiword capitalized phrases, the first word can belong to the rest of the phrase\nor can be just an external modifier. In the sentence Daily, Mason and Partners lost their\ncourt case, it is clear that Daily, Mason and Partners is the name of a company. In the\nsentence Unfortunately, Mason and Partners lost their court case, the name of the company\ndoes not include the word Unfortunately, but the word Daily is just as common a word\nas Unfortunately.\nIdentification of proper names is also important in machine translation, because\nusually proper names are transliterated (i.e., phonetically translated) rather than prop-\nerly (semantically) translated. In confidential texts, such as medical records, proper\nnames must be identified and removed before making such texts available to people\nunauthorized to have access to personally identifiable information. And in general,\nmost tasks that involve text analysis will benefit from the robust disambiguation of\ncapitalized words into proper names and common words.\nAnother important task of text normalization is sentence boundary disambigua-\ntion (SBD) or sentence splitting. Segmenting text into sentences is an important aspect\nin developing many applications: syntactic parsing, information extraction, machine\ntranslation, question answering, text alignment, document summarization, etc. Sen-\ntence splitting in most cases is a simple matter: a period, an exclamation mark, or a\nquestion mark usually signals a sentence boundary. In certain cases, however, a period\ndenotes a decimal point or is a part of an abbreviation, and thus it does not necessarily\nsignal a sentence boundary. Furthermore, an abbreviation itself can be the last token\nin a sentence in which case its period acts at the same time as part of this abbreviation\nand as the end-of-sentence indicator (fullstop). A detailed introduction to the SBD\nproblem can be found in Palmer and Hearst (1997).\nThe disambiguation of capitalized words and sentence boundaries presents a\nchicken-and-egg problem. If we know that a capitalized word that follows a period is\na common word, we can safely assign such period as sentence terminal. On the other\nhand, if we know that a period is not sentence terminal, then we can conclude that\nthe following capitalized word is a proper name.\nAnother frequent source of ambiguity in end-of-sentence marking is introduced by\nabbreviations: if we know that the word that precedes a period is not an abbreviation,\nthen almost certainly this period denotes a sentence boundary. If, however, this word\nis an abbreviation, then it is not that easy to make a clear decision. This problem is\nexacerbated by the fact that abbreviations do not form a closed set; that is, one can-\nnot list all possible abbreviations. Moreover, abbreviations can coincide with regular\nwords; for example, ?in? can denote an abbreviation for ?inches,? ?no? can denote an\nabbreviation for ?number,? and ?bus? can denote an abbreviation for ?business.?\nIn this article we present a method that tackles sentence boundaries, capitalized\nwords, and abbreviations in a uniform way through a document-centered approach.\nAs opposed to the two dominant techniques of computing statistics about the words\nthat surround potential sentence boundaries or writing specialized grammars, our ap-\n"},{"#tail":"\n","@confidence":"0.89207875","#text":"\nMikheev Periods, Capitalized Words, etc.\nproach disambiguates capitalized words and abbreviations by considering suggestive\nlocal contexts and repetitions of individual words within a document.

It contains over one million word tokens\nand is composed from 15 subcorpora that belong to different genres and domains,\nranging from news wire texts and scientific papers to fiction and transcribed speech.\nThe Brown corpus is rich in out-of-vocabulary (unknown) words, spelling errors, and\nungrammatical sentences with complex internal structure.

In the traditional Penn Treebank schema, abbrevi-\nations are tokenized together with their trailing periods, and thus stand-alone periods\nunambiguously signal the end of a sentence. We decided to treat periods and all other\npotential sentence termination punctuation as ?first-class citizens? and adopted a con-\nvention always to tokenize a period (and other punctuation) as a separate token when\nit is followed by a white space, line break, or punctuation. In the original Penn Tree-\nbank format, periods are unambiguous, whereas in our new convention they can take\non one of the three tags: fullstop (.), part of abbreviation (A) or both (*).\nTo generate the new format from the Penn Treebank, we had to split final periods\nfrom abbreviations, mark them as separate tokens and assign them with A or * tags\naccording to whether or not the abbreviation was the last token in a sentence. We\napplied a similar tokenization convention to the case in which several (usually three)\nperiods signal ellipsis in a sentence. Again, sometimes such constructions occur within\na sentence and sometimes at a sentence break. We decided to treat such constructions\nsimilarly to abbreviations, tokenize all periods but the last together in a single token,\nand tokenize the last period separately and tag it with A or * according to whether\nor not the ellipsis was the last token in a sentence. We treated periods in numbers\n(e.g., 14.534) or inside acronyms (e.g., Y.M.C.A.) as part of tokens rather than separate\nperiods.\nIn all our experiments we treated embedded sentence boundaries in the same way\nas normal sentence boundaries. An embedded sentence boundary occurs when there\nis a sentence inside a sentence. This can be a quoted direct-speech subsentence inside a\nsentence, a subsentence embedded in brackets, etc. We considered closing punctuation\nof such sentences equal to closing punctuation of normal sentences.\nWe also specially marked word tokens in positions where they were ambiguously\ncapitalized if such word tokens occurred in one of the following contexts:\n? the first token in a sentence\n? following a separately tokenized period, question mark, exclamation\nmark, semicolon, colon, opening quote, closing quote, opening bracket,\nor closed bracket\n? occurring in a sentence with all words capitalized\nAll described transformations were performed automatically by applying a simple\nPerl script.

Thus a word without vowels can be guessed to be an abbreviation\nunless it is written in all capital letters and can stand for an acronym or a proper name\n(e.g., BBC). A span of single letters separated by periods forms an abbreviation too\n(e.g., Y.M.C.A.).

All other words are considered to be nonabbreviations.\nThese heuristics are reasonably accurate. On the WSJ corpus they misrecognized\nas abbreviations only 0.2% of tokens. On the Brown corpus the misrecognition rate was\nsignificantly higher: 1.6%. The major source for these errors were single letters that\nstand for mathematical symbols in the scientific subcorpora of the Brown Corpus (e.g.,\npoint T or triangle F).

Document-Centered Approach to Proper Name and Abbreviation Handling\nAs we discussed above, virtually any common word can potentially act as a proper\nname or part of a multiword proper name. The same applies to abbreviations: there is\nno fixed list of abbreviations, and almost any short word can be used as an abbrevia-\ntion. Fortunately, there is a mitigating factor too: important words are typically used\nin a document more than once and in different contexts. Some of these contexts create\n"},{"#tail":"\n","@confidence":"0.996351619047619","#text":"\nComputational Linguistics Volume 28, Number 3\nambiguity, but some do not. Furthermore, ambiguous words and phrases are usually\nunambiguously introduced at least once in the text unless they are part of common\nknowledge presupposed to be possessed by the readers.\nThis observation can be applied to a broader class of tasks. For example, people\nare often referred to by their surnames (e.g., Black) but are usually introduced at least\nonce in the text either with their first name (John Black) or with their title/profession\naffiliation (Mr. Black, President Bush), and it is only when their names are common\nknowledge that they do not need an introduction (e.g., Castro, Gorbachev). Thus our\nsuggestion is to look at the unambiguous usages of the words in question in the entire document.\nIn the case of proper name identification, we are not concerned with the semantic\nclass of a name (e.g., whether it is a person?s name or a location), but rather we simply\nwant to distinguish whether a capitalized word in a particular occurrence acts as a\nproper name (or part of a multiword proper name). If we restrict our scope to a single\nsentence, we might find that there is just not enough information to make a reliable\ndecision. For instance, Riders in the sentence Riders rode all over the green is equally likely\nto be a proper noun, a plural proper noun, or a plural common noun. But if in the\nsame text we find John Riders, this sharply increases the likelihood that the proper noun\ninterpretation is the correct one, and conversely if we find many riders, this suggests\nthe plural-noun interpretation.\nThe above reasoning can be summarized as follows: if we detect that a word is\nused capitalized in an unambiguous context, this increases the chances that this word\nacts as a proper name in ambiguous positions in the same document. And conversely\nif a word is seen only lower-cased, this increases the chances that it should be treated\nas a common word even when used capitalized in ambiguous positions in the same\ndocument. (This, of course, is only a general principle and will be further elaborated\nelsewhere in the article.)\nThe same logic applies to abbreviations. Although a short word followed by a\nperiod is a potential abbreviation, the same word occurring in the same document\nin a different context can be unambiguously classified as a regular word if it is used\nwithout a trailing period, or it can be unambiguously classified as an abbreviation if\nit is used with a trailing period and is followed by a lower-cased word or a comma.\nThis information gives us a better chance of assigning these potential abbreviations\ncorrectly in nonobvious contexts.\nWe call such style of processing a document-centered approach (DCA), since in-\nformation for the disambiguation of an individual word token is derived from the\nentire document rather than from its immediate local context. Essentially the system\ncollects suggestive instances of usage for target words from each document under\nprocessing and applies this information on the fly to the processing of the document,\nin a manner similar to instance-based learning. This differentiates DCA from the tradi-\ntional corpus-based approach, in which learning is applied prior to processing, which\nis usually performed with supervision over multiple documents of the training corpus.\n"},{"#tail":"\n","@confidence":"0.9968986","#text":"\nOur method requires only four word lists.

We used these\ntexts because the approach described in this article was initially designed to be part\nof a named-entity recognition system (Mikheev, Grover, and Moens 1998) developed\nfor MUC-7. Although the corpus size of 300,000 words can be seen as large, the fact\nthat this corpus does not have to be annotated in any way and that a corpus of similar\nsize can be easily collected from on-line sources (including the Internet) makes this\nresource cheap to obtain.\nThe first list on which our method relies is a list of common words. This list\nincludes common words for a given language, but no supplementary information such\nas POS or morphological information is required to be present in this list. A variety\nof such lists for many languages are already available (e.g., Burnage 1990). Words in\nsuch lists are usually supplemented with morphological and POS information (which\nis not required by our method). We do not have to rely on pre-existing resources,\nhowever. A list of common words can be easily obtained automatically from a raw\n(unannotated in any way) text collection by simply collecting and counting lower-\ncased words in it. We generated such list from the NYT collection. To account for\npotential spelling and capitalization errors, we included in the list of common words\nonly words that occurred lower-cased at least three times in the NYT texts. The list\nof common words that we developed from the NYT collection contained about 15,000\nEnglish words.\nThe second list on which our method relies is a frequent-starters list, a list of\ncommon words most frequently used in sentence-starting positions. This list can also\nbe obtained completely automatically from an unannotated corpus by applying the\nlexical-lookup strategy. As discussed in Section 3.2, this strategy performs with a\n7?15% error rate. We applied the list of common words over the NYT text collec-\ntion to tag capitalized words in sentence-starting positions as common words and as\nproper names: if a capitalized word was found in the list of common words, it was\ntagged as a common word: otherwise it was tagged as a proper name. Of course, such\ntagging was far from perfect, but it was good enough for our purposes. We included in\nthe frequent-starters list only the 200 most frequent sentence-starting common words.\nThis was more than a safe threshold to ensure that no wrongly tagged words were\nadded to this list. As one might predict, the most frequent sentence-starting common\nword was The. This list also included some adverbs, such as However, Suddenly, and\nOnce; some prepositions, such as In, To, and By; and even a few verbs: Let, Have, Do, etc.\nThe third list on which our method relies is a list of single-word proper names that\ncoincide with common words. For instance, the word Japan is much more likely to be\nused as a proper name (name of a country) rather than a verb, and therefore it needs to\nbe included in this list. We included in the proper name list 200 words that were most\nfrequently seen in the NYT text collection as single capitalized words in unambiguous\npositions and that at the same time were present in the list of common words. For\ninstance, the word The can frequently be seen capitalized in unambiguous positions,\nbut it is always followed by another capitalized word, so we do not count it as a\ncandidate.

Thus, in\naddition to the list of known abbreviations and the guessing heuristics, we decided to\napply the DCA as described below.\nEach word of length four characters or less that is followed by a period is treated as\na potential abbreviation. First, the system collects unigrams of potential abbreviations\nin unambiguous contexts from the document under processing. If a potential abbre-\nviation is used elsewhere in the document without a trailing period, we can conclude\nthat it in fact is not an abbreviation but rather a regular word (nonabbreviation). To\ndecide whether a potential abbreviation is really an abbreviation, we look for contexts\nin which it is followed by a period and then by a lower-cased word, a number, or a\ncomma.\nFor instance, the word Kong followed by a period and then by a capitalized word\ncannot be safely classified as a regular word (nonabbreviation), and therefore it is a\npotential abbreviation. But if in the same document we detect a context lived in Hong\nKong in 1993, this indicates that Kong in this document is normally written without\na trailing period and hence is not an abbreviation.

We call this the sequence strategy.\nThe rationale behind this strategy is that if there is a phrase of two or more capitalized\nwords starting from an unambiguous position (e.g., following a lower-cased word),\nthe system can be reasonably confident that even when the same phrase starts from an\nunreliable position (e.g., after a period), all its words still have to be grouped together\nand hence are proper nouns. Moreover, this applies not just to the exact replication of\nthe capitalized phrase, but to any partial ordering of its words of size two characters\nor more preserving their sequence.\nFor instance, if a phrase Rocket Systems Development Co. is found in a document\nstarting from an unambiguous position (e.g., after a lower-cased word, a number, or a\ncomma), the system collects it and also generates its partial-order subphrases: Rocket\nSystems, Rocket Systems Co., Rocket Co., Systems Development, etc. If then in the same\ndocument Rocket Systems is found in an ambiguous position (e.g., after a period), the\nsystem will assign the word Rocket as a proper noun because it is part of a multiword\nproper name that was seen in the unambiguous context.\nA span of capitalized words can also internally include alpha-numerals, abbrevia-\ntions with internal periods, symbols, and lower-cased words of length three characters\nor shorter. This enables the system to capture phrases like A & M and The Phantom of\nthe Opera. Partial orders from such phrases are generated in a similar way, but with\nthe restriction that every generated subphrase should start and end with a capitalized\nword.\nThe sequence strategy can also be applied to disambiguate common words. Since\nin the case of common words the system cannot determine boundaries of a phrase,\nonly bigrams of the lower-cased words with their following words are collected from\nthe document. For instance, from a context continental suppliers of Mercury, the sys-\ntem collects three bigrams: continental suppliers, suppliers of, and of Mercury. When the\nsystem encounters the phrase Continental suppliers after a period, it can now use the\ninformation that in the previously stored bigram continental suppliers, the word token\ncontinental was written lower-cased and therefore was unambiguously used as a com-\nmon word. On this basis the system can assign the ambiguous capitalized word token\nContinental as a common word.\nRow A of Table 3 displays the results obtained in the application of the sequence\nstrategy to the Brown corpus and the WSJ corpus. The sequence strategy is extremely\nuseful when we are dealing with names of organizations, since many of them are\nmultiword phrases composed of common words. For instance, the words Rocket and\nInsurance can be used both as proper names and common words within the same\ndocument. The sequence strategy maintains contexts of the usages of such words\nwithin the same document, and thus it can disambiguate such usages in the ambiguous\npositions matching surrounding words. And indeed, the error rate of this strategy\nwhen applied to proper names was below 1%, with coverage of about 9?12%.\nFor tagging common words the sequence strategy was also very accurate (error\nrate less than 0.3%), covering 17% of ambiguous capitalized common words on the\nWSJ corpus and 25% on the Brown corpus. The higher coverage on the Brown corpus\ncan be explained by the fact that the documents in that corpus are in general longer\nthan those in the WSJ corpus, which enables more word bigrams to be collected from\na document.\nDual application of the sequence strategy contributes to its robustness against po-\ntential capitalization errors in the document.

On common words this method is not as effective,\nwith an error rate as high as 6.61% on the WSJ corpus and a coverage below 5%.\nThe single-word-assignment strategy handles well the so-called unknown-word\nproblem, which arises when domain-specific lexica are missing from a general vocab-\nulary. Since our system is not equipped with a general vocabulary but rather builds a\ndocument-specific vocabulary on the fly,? important domain-specific words are iden-\ntified and treated similarly to all other words.\nA generally difficult case for the single-word assignment strategy arises when a\nword is used both as a proper name and as a common word in the same document, es-\npecially when one of these usages occurs only in an ambiguous position. For instance,\nin a document about steel, the only occurrence of Steel Company happened to start\na sentence. This produced an erroneous assignment of the word Steel as a common\nword. Another example: in a document about the Acting Judge, the word acting in a\nsentence Acting on behalf. . . was wrongly classified as a proper name. These difficulties,\nhowever, often are compensated for by the sequence strategy, which is applied prior\nto the single-word assignment strategy and tackles such cases using n-grams of words.\n7.4 Quotes, Brackets, and ?After Abbr.? Heuristic\nCapitalized words in quotes and brackets do not directly contribute to our primary\ntask of sentence boundary disambiguation, but they still present a case of ambiguity\nfor the task of capitalized-word disambiguation. To tackle them we applied two simple\nheuristics:\n"},{"#tail":"\n","@confidence":"0.971700416666667","#text":"\nComputational Linguistics Volume 28, Number 3\nThese heuristics are reasonably accurate: they achieved under 2% error rate on our\ntwo test corpora, but they covered only about 6?7% of proper names.\nWhen we studied the distribution of capitalized words after capitalized abbrevi-\nations, we uncovered an interesting empirical fact. A capitalized word that follows\na capitalized abbreviation is almost certainly a proper name unless it is listed in the\nlist of frequent sentence-starting common words (i.e., it is not The, However, etc.). The\nerror rate of this heuristic is about 0.8% and, not surprisingly, in 99.5% of cases the\nabbreviation and the following proper name belonged to the same sentence. Naturally,\nthe coverage of this ?after abbr.? heuristic depends on the proportion of capitalized\nabbreviations in the text. In our two corpora this heuristic disambiguated about 20%\nof ambiguous capitalized proper names.\n"},{"#tail":"\n","@confidence":"0.986598611111111","#text":"\nIn general, the cascading application of the above-described strategies achieved an\nerror rate of about 1%, but it left unclassified about 9% of ambiguous capitalized\nwords in the Brown corpus and 15% of such words in the WSJ corpus. Row D of\nTable 3 displays the results of the application of the cascading application of the\ncapitalized-word disambiguation strategies to the Brown corpus and the WSJ corpus.\nFor the proper-name category, the most productive strategy was single-word as-\nsignment, followed by the ?after abbr.? strategy, and then the sequence strategy. For\ncommon words, the most productive was the frequent-list lookup strategy, followed\nby the sequence strategy.\nSince our system left unassigned 10?15% of ambiguous capitalized words, we have\nto decide what to do with them. To keep our system simple and domain independent,\nwe opted for the lexical-lookup strategy that we evaluated in Section 3. This strategy,\nof course, is not very accurate, but it is applied only to the unassigned words. Row E\nof Table 3 displays the results of applying the lexical-lookup strategy after the DCA\nmethods. We see that the error rate went up in comparison to the DCA-only method\nby more than three times (2.9% on the Brown corpus and 4.9% on the WSJ corpus),\nbut no unassigned ambiguous capitalized words are left in the text.\n8. Putting It All Together: Assigning Sentence Boundaries\nAfter abbreviations have been identified and capitalized words have been classified\ninto proper names and common words, the system can carry out the assignments\nof sentence boundaries using the SBD rule set described in Section 3 and listed in\nAppendix A. This rule set makes use of the observation that if we have at our dis-\nposal unambiguous (but not necessarily correct) information as to whether a particular\nword that precedes a period is an abbreviation and whether the word that follows\nthis period is a proper name, then in mixed-case texts we can easily assign a pe-\nriod (and other potential sentence termination punctuation) as a sentence break or\nnot.\nThe only ambiguous outcome is generated by the configuration in which an ab-\nbreviation is followed by a proper name. We decided to handle this case by applying\na crude and simple strategy of always resolving it as ?not sentence boundary.? On one\nhand, this makes our method simple and robust, but on the other hand, it imposes\nsome penalty on its performance.\nRow A of Table 4 summarizes the upper bound for our SBD approach: when we\nhave entirely correct information on the abbreviations and proper names, as explained\nin Section 3.1. There the erroneous assignments come only from the crude treatment\nof abbreviations that are followed by proper names.\n"},{"#tail":"\n","@confidence":"0.995139939393939","#text":"\napproach was estimated by applying the lexical-lookup strategy for capitalized-word\ndisambiguation together with the abbreviation-guessing heuristics to feed the SBD\nrule set, as described in Section 3.2.

State-of-the-\nart machine learning and rule-based SBD systems achieve an error rate of 0.8?1.5%\nmeasured on the Brown corpus and the WSJ corpus. The best performance on the\nWSJ corpus was achieved by a combination of the SATZ system (Palmer and Hearst\n1997) with the Alembic system (Aberdeen et al 1995): a 0.5% error rate. The best\nperformance on the Brown corpus, a 0.2% error rate, was reported by Riley (1989), who\ntrained a decision tree classifier on a 25-million-word corpus. In the disambiguation of\ncapitalized words, the most widespread method is POS tagging, which achieves about\na 3% error rate on the Brown corpus and a 5% error rate on the WSJ corpus, as reported\nin Mikheev (2000). We are not aware of any studies devoted to the identification of\nabbreviations with comprehensive evaluation on either the Brown corpus or the WSJ\ncorpus.\nIn row D of Table 4, we summarized our main results: the results obtained by the\napplication of our SBD rule set, which uses the information provided by the DCA to\ncapitalized word disambiguation applied together with lexical lookup (as described\nin Section 7.5), and the abbreviation-handling strategy, which included the guessing\nheuristics, the DCA, and the list of 270 abbreviations (as described in Section 6).

The results\nfor this configuration are summarized in row E of Table 4. The error rate increase of\n5?7% on the abbreviation handling introduced about a twofold increase in the SBD\nerror rate on the Brown corpus (a 0.65% error rate) and about a threefold increase on\nthe WSJ corpus (1.41%). But these results are still comparable to those of the majority\nof currently used sentence splitters.\n9. Detecting Limits for the DCA\nSince our DCA method relies on the assumption that the words it tries to disam-\nbiguate occur multiple times in a document, its performance clearly should depend\non the length of the document: very short documents possibly do not provide enough\ndisambiguation clues, whereas very long documents possibly contain too many clues\nthat cancel each other.\nAs noted in Section 2.1, the average length of the documents in the Brown corpus\nis about 2,300 words. Also, the documents in that corpus are distributed very densely\naround their mean. Thus not much can be inferred about the dependency of the perfor-\nmance of the method on document length apart from the observation that documents\n2,000?3,000 words long are handled well by our approach. In the WSJ corpus, the aver-\nage length of the document is about 500 words, and therefore we could investigate the\neffect of short documents on the performance. We divided documents into six groups\naccording to their length and plotted the error rate for the SBD and capitalized-word\ndisambiguation tasks as well as the number of documents in a group, as shown in\nFigure 2. As can be seen in the figure, short documents (50 words or less) have the\nhighest average error rate both for the SBD task (1.63) and for the capitalized-word\ndisambiguation task (5.25). For documents 50 to 100 words long, the error rate is still\na bit higher than normal, and for longer documents the error rate stabilizes around\n1.5 for the capitalized-word disambiguation task and 0.3 for the SBD task. The error\nrate on documents 2,000 words long and higher is almost identical to that registered\non the Brown corpus on documents of the same length.\nThus here we can conclude that the proposed approach tends not to be very\neffective for documents shorter than 50 words (one to three sentences), but it handles\nwell documents up to 4,000 words long. Since our corpora did not contain documents\nsignificantly longer than that, we could not estimate whether or when the performance\nof our method significantly deteriorates on longer documents. We also evaluated the\nperformance of the method on different subcorpora of the Brown corpus: the most\ndifficult subdomains proved to be scientific texts, spoken-language transcripts, and\njournalistic texts, whereas fiction was the easiest genre for the system.\n10. Incorporating DCA into a POS Tagger\nTo test our hypothesis that DCA can be used as a complement to a local-context\napproach, we combined our main configuration (evaluated in row D of Table 4) with\na POS tagger. Unlike other POS taggers, this POS tagger (Mikheev 2000) was also\ntrained to disambiguate sentence boundaries.\n10.1 Training a POS Tagger\nIn our markup convention (Section 2), periods are tokenized as separate tokens re-\ngardless of whether they stand for fullstops or belong to abbreviations. Consequently\na POS tagger can naturally treat them similarly to any other ambiguous words. There\nis, however, one difference in the implementation of such a tagger. Normally, a POS\n"},{"#tail":"\n","@confidence":"0.996613545454546","#text":"\nDistribution of the error rate and the number of documents across the document length\n(measured in word tokens) in the WSJ corpus.\ntagger operates on text spans that form a sentence. This requires resolving sentence\nboundaries before tagging. We see no good reason, however, why such text spans\nshould necessarily be sentences, since the majority of tagging paradigms (e.g., Hidden\nMarkov Model [HMM] [Kupiec 1992], Brill?s [Brill 1995a], and MaxEnt [Ratnaparkhi\n1996]) do not attempt to parse an entire sentence and operate only in the local win-\ndow of two to three tokens. The only reason why taggers traditionally operate on\nthe sentence level is that a sentence naturally represents a text span in which POS\ninformation does not depend on the previous and following history.\nThis issue can be also addressed by breaking the text into short text spans at\npositions where the previous tagging history does not affect current decisions. For\ninstance, a bigram tagger operates within a window of two tokens, and thus a se-\nquence of word tokens can be terminated at an unambiguous word token, since this\nunambiguous word token will be the only history used in tagging of the next token.\nAt the same time since this token is unambiguous, it is not affected by the history.\nA trigram tagger operates within a window of three tokens, and thus a sequence of\nword tokens can be terminated when two unambiguous words follow each other.\nUsing Penn Treebank with our tokenization convention (Section 2), we trained a\ntrigram HMM POS tagger. Words were clustered into ambiguity classes (Kupiec 1992)\naccording to the sets of POS tags they can take on. The tagger predictions were based\non the ambiguity class of the current word, abbreviation/capitalization information,\n"},{"#tail":"\n","@confidence":"0.75434","#text":"\nComputational Linguistics Volume 28, Number 3\nand trigrams of POS tags:\n"},{"#tail":"\n","@confidence":"0.996528682926829","#text":"\nwhere ti is a disambiguated POS tag of the ith word, ai is the abbreviation flag of\nthe ith word, and Oi is the observation at the ith position, which in our case is\nthe ambiguity class the word belongs to, its capitalization, and its abbreviation flag\n(AmbClassi, ai, Capi). Since the abbreviation flag of the previous word strongly influ-\nences period disambiguation, it was included in the standard trigram model.\nWe decided to train the tagger with the minimum of preannotated resources. First,\nwe used 20,000 tagged words to ?bootstrap? the training process, because purely un-\nsupervised techniques, at least for the HMM class of taggers, yield lower precision.\nWe also used our DCA system to assign capitalized words, abbreviations, and sen-\ntence breaks, retaining only cases assigned by the strategies with an accuracy not less\nthan 99.8%. This was done because purely unsupervised techniques (e.g., Baum-Welch\n[Baum and Petrie 1966] or Brill?s [Brill 1995b]) enable regularities to be induced for\nword classes which contain many entries, exploiting the fact that individual words that\nbelong to a POS class occur in different ambiguity patterns. Counting all possible POS\ncombinations in these ambiguity patterns over multiple patterns usually produces the\nright combinations as the most frequent.

For\nevaluation purposes we trained (and bootstrapped) our tagger on the Brown corpus\nand applied it to the WSJ corpus and vice versa. We preferred this method to tenfold\ncross-validation because it allowed us to produce only two tagging models instead of\ntwenty and also enabled us to test the tagger in harsher conditions, that is, when it is\napplied to texts that are very distant from the ones on which it was trained.\nThe overall performance of the tagger was close to 96%, which is a bit lower\nthan the best quoted results. This can be accounted for by the fact that training and\nevaluation were performed on two very different text corpora, as explained above.\nThe performance of the tagger on our target categories (periods and proper names)\nwas very close to that of the DCA method, as can be seen in row F of Table 4.\n10.2 POS Tagger and the DCA\nWe felt that the DCA method could be used as a complement to the POS tagger, since\nthese techniques employ different types of information: in-document distribution and\nlocal context. Thus, a hybrid system can deliver at least two advantages.

Second, the local context can correct some of the\nerrors made by the DCA.\nTo implement this hybrid approach we incorporated the DCA system into the\nPOS tagger.

The main rea-\nson for not carrying over the information that has been inferred from one document\nto process another document is that in general we do not know whether this new\ndocument comes from the same corpus as the first document, and thus the regular-\nities that have been identified in the first document might not be useful, but rather\nharmful, when applied to that new document.

These bigrams are used\ntogether with the bigrams induced on the fly. This strategy proved to be quite useful:\nit covered another 2% of unresolved cases (before applying the lexical lookup), with\nan error rate of less than 1%.\n11.2 Handling Russian News\nTo test how easy it is to apply the DCA to a new language, we tested it on a corpus\nof British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) news in Russian. We collected this corpus\nfrom the Internet ?http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/russian/world/default.htm? over a period of 30\ndays. This gave us a corpus of 300 short documents (one or two paragraphs each).\nWe automatically created the supporting resources from 364,000 documents from the\nRussian corpus of the European Corpus Initiative, using the method described in\nsection 5.\nSince, unlike English, Russian is a highly inflected language, we had to deal with\nthe case normalization issue. Before using the DCA method, we applied a Russian\nmorphological processor (Mikheev and Liubushkina 1995) to convert each word in\nthe text to its main form: nominative case singular for nouns and adjectives, infinitive\nfor verbs, etc. For words that could be normalized to several main forms (polysemy),\nwhen secondary forms of different words coincided, we retained all the main forms.\nSince the documents in the BBC news corpus were rather short, we applied the cache\nmodule, as described in Section 11.1. This allowed us to reuse information across the\ndocuments.\nRussian proved to be a simpler case than English for our tasks. First, on average,\nRussian words are longer than English words: thus the identification of abbreviations\nis simpler. Second, proper names in Russian coincide less frequently with common\nwords; this makes the disambiguation of capitalized words in ambiguous positions\neasier.

For handling very\nlong documents with our method, however, the information decay strategy seems to\nbe the right way to proceed.\nMani and MacMillan (1995) pointed out that little attention had been paid in the\nnamed-entity recognition field to the discourse properties of proper names. They pro-\nposed that proper names be viewed as linguistic expressions whose interpretation\noften depends on the discourse context, advocating text-driven processing rather than\nreliance on pre-existing lists. The DCA outlined in this article also uses nonlocal dis-\ncourse context and does not heavily rely on pre-existing word lists. It has been applied\nnot only to the identification of proper names, as described in this article, but also to\ntheir classification (Mikheev, Grover, and Moens 1998).\nGale, Church, and Yarowsky (1992) showed that words strongly tend to exhibit\nonly one sense in a document or discourse (?one sense per discourse?). Since then\nthis idea has been applied to several tasks, including word sense disambiguation\n(Yarowsky 1995) and named-entity recognition (Cucerzan and Yarowsky 1999). Gale,\nChurch, and Yarowsky?s observation is also used in our DCA, especially for the iden-\ntification of abbreviations. In capitalized-word disambiguation, however, we use this\nassumption with caution and first apply strategies that rely not just on single words\nbut on words together with their local contexts (n-grams). This is similar to ?one sense\nper collocation? idea of Yarowsky (1993).\nThe description of the EAGLE workbench for linguistic engineering (Baldwin et al\n1997) mentions a case normalization module that uses a heuristic in which a capitalized\nword in an ambiguous position should be rewritten without capitalization if it is found\nlower-cased in the same document. This heuristic also employs a database of bigrams\nand unigrams of lower-cased and capitalized words found in unambiguous positions.\nIt is quite similar to our method for capitalized-word disambiguation. The description\nof the EAGLE case normalization module provided by Baldwin et al is, however, very\nbrief and provides no performance evaluation or other details.\n"},{"#tail":"\n","@confidence":"0.979737388888889","#text":"\n12.2.1 Sentence Boundary Disambiguation. There exist two large classes of SBD sys-\ntems: rule based and machine learning.

For instance, the Alembic workbench (Aberdeen et\nal. 1995) contains a sentence-splitting module that employs over 100 regular-expression\nrules written in Flex.

This implies an investment in the data\nannotation phase.\nThe main difference between the existing machine learning and rule-based meth-\nods for the SBD task and our approach is that we decomposed the SBD task into\nseveral subtasks. We decided to tackle the SBD task through the disambiguation of\nthe period preceding and following words and then feed this information into a very\nsimple SBD rule set. In contrast, the standard practice in building SBD software is to\ndisambiguate configurations of a period with its ambiguous local context in a single\nstep, either by encoding disambiguation clues into the rules or inferring a classifier\nthat accounts for the ambiguity of the words on the left and on the right of the period.\nOur approach to SBD is closer in spirit to machine learning methods because its\nretargeting does not require rule reengineering and can be done completely automat-\nically. Unlike traditional machine learning SBD approaches, however, our approach\ndoes not require annotated data for training.\n12.2.2 Disambiguation of Capitalized Words. Disambiguation of capitalized words\nis usually handled by POS taggers, which treat capitalized words in the same way\nas other categories, that is, by accounting for the immediate syntactic context and\nusing estimates collected from a training corpus. As Church (1988) rightly pointed\nout, however, ?Proper nouns and capitalized words are particularly problematic: some\ncapitalized words are proper nouns and some are not. Estimates from the Brown\nCorpus can be misleading. For example, the capitalized word ?Acts? is found twice in\nthe Brown Corpus, both times as a proper noun (in a title). It would be misleading to\ninfer from this evidence that the word ?Acts? is always a proper noun.?\nIn the information extraction field, the disambiguation of ambiguous capitalized\nwords has always been tightly linked to the classification of proper names into seman-\ntic classes such as person name, location, and company name. Named-entity recogni-\ntion systems usually use sets of complex hand-crafted rules that employ a gazetteer\nand a local context (Krupa and Hausman 1998). In some systems such dependencies\nare learned from labeled examples (Bikel et al 1997). The advantage of the named-\nentity approach is that the system not only identifies proper names but also determines\ntheir semantic class. The disadvantage is in the cost of building a wide-coverage set of\ncontextual clues manually or producing annotated training data. Also, the contextual\nclues are usually highly specific to the domain and text genre, making such systems\nvery difficult to port.\nBoth POS taggers and named-entity recognizers are normally built using the local-\ncontext paradigm. In contrast, we opted for a method that relies on the entire distri-\nbution of a word in a document. Although it is possible to train some classes of POS\ntaggers without supervision, this usually leads to suboptimal performance. Thus the\nmajority of taggers are trained using at least some labeled data. Named-entity recog-\nnition systems are usually hand-crafted or trained from labeled data. As was shown\nabove, our method does not require supervised training.\n12.2.3 Disambiguation of Abbreviations. Not much information has been published\non abbreviation identification. One of the better-known approaches is described in\nGrefenstette and Tapanainen (1994), which suggested that abbreviations first be ex-\ntracted from a corpus using abbreviation-guessing heuristics akin to those described\nin Section 6 and then reused in further processing.

Then for this set of can-\ndidates the system tries to find in the text their definitions (e.g., United Kingdom for\nUK). The abbreviation recognizer for these purposes is allowed to overgenerate signif-\nicantly. There is no harm (apart from the performance issues) in proposing too many\ncandidate abbreviations, because only those that can be linked to their definitions will\nbe retained. Therefore the abbreviation recognizer treats as a candidate any token of\ntwo to ten characters that contains at least one capital letter. Candidates then are fil-\ntered through a set of known common words and proper names. At the same time\nmany good abbreviations and acronyms are filtered out because not for all of them\nwill definitions exist in the current document.\nIn our task we are interested in finding all and only abbreviations that end with\na period (proper abbreviations rather than acronyms), regardless of whether they can\nbe linked to their definitions in the current document or not. Therefore, in our method\nwe cannot tolerate candidate overgeneration or excessive filtering and had to develop\nmore selective methods for finding abbreviations in text.\n13. Discussion\nIn this article we presented an approach that tackles three important aspects of text nor-\nmalization: sentence boundary disambiguation, disambiguation of capitalized words\nwhen they are used in positions where capitalization is expected, and identification of\nabbreviations. The major distinctive features of our approach can be summarized as\nfollows:\n? We tackle the sentence boundary task only after we have fully\ndisambiguated the word on the left and the word on the right of a\npotential sentence boundary punctuation sign.\n? To disambiguate capitalized words and abbreviations, we use\ninformation distributed across the entire document rather than their\nimmediate local context.\n? Our approach does not require manual rule construction or data\nannotation for training. Instead, it relies on four word lists that can be\ngenerated completely automatically from a raw (unlabeled) corpus.\nIn this approach we do not try to resolve each ambiguous word occurrence individu-\nally. Instead, the system scans the entire document for the contexts in which the words\nin question are used unambiguously, and this gives it grounds, acting by analogy, for\nresolving ambiguous contexts.\nWe deliberately shaped our approach so that it largely does not rely on precom-\npiled statistics, because the most interesting events are inherently infrequent and hence\nare difficult to collect reliable statistics for. At the same time precompiled statistics\nwould be smoothed across multiple documents rather than targeted to a specific docu-\nment. By collecting suggestive instances of usage for target words from each particular\ndocument on the fly, rather than relying on preacquired resources smoothed across the\nentire document collection, our approach is robust to domain shifts and new lexica\nand closely targeted to each document.\n"},{"#tail":"\n","@confidence":"0.997280104166667","#text":"\nComputational Linguistics Volume 28, Number 3\nA significant advantage of this approach is that it can be targeted to new domains\ncompletely automatically, without human intervention. The four word lists that our\nsystem uses for its operation can be generated automatically from a raw corpus and\nrequire no human annotation. Although some SBD systems can be trained on relatively\nsmall sets of labeled examples, their performance in such cases is somewhat lower than\ntheir optimal performance. For instance, Palmer and Hearst (1997) report that the SATZ\nsystem (decision tree variant) was trained on a set of about 800 labeled periods, which\ncorresponds to a corpus of about 16,000 words. This is a relatively small training set\nthat can be manually marked in a few hours? time. But the error rate (1.5%) of the\ndecision tree classifier trained on this small sample was about 50% higher than that\nwhen trained on 6,000 labeled examples (1.0%).\nThe performance of our system does not depend on the availability of labeled\ntraining examples. For its ?training,? it uses a raw (unannotated in any way) corpus\nof texts. Although it needs such a corpus to be relatively large (a few hundred thousand\nwords), this is normally not a problem, since when the system is targeted to a new\ndomain, such a corpus is usually already available at no extra cost. Therefore there is no\ntrade-off between the amount of human labor and the performance of the system. This\nnot only makes retargeting of such system easier but also enables it to be operational\nin a completely autonomous way: it needs only to be pointed to texts from a new\ndomain, and then it can retarget itself automatically.\nAlthough the DCA requires two passes through a document, the simplicity of the\nunderlying algorithms makes it reasonably fast. It processes about 3,000 words per\nsecond using a Pentium II 400 MHz processor. This includes identification of abbre-\nviations, disambiguation of capitalized words, and then disambiguation of sentence\nboundaries. This is comparable to the speed of other preprocessing systems.3 The oper-\national speed is about 10% higher than the training speed because, apart from applying\nthe system to the training corpus, training also involves collecting, thresholding, and\nsorting of the word lists?all done automatically but at extra time cost. Training on\nthe 300,000-word NYT text collection took about two minutes.\nDespite its simplicity, the performance of our approach was on the level with\nthe previously highest reported results on the same test collections. The error rate\non sentence boundaries in the Brown corpus was not significantly worse than the\nlowest quoted before (Riley 1989: 0.28% vs. 0.20% error rate). On the WSJ corpus\nour system performed slightly better than the combination of the Alembic and SATZ\nsystems described in Palmer and Hearst (1997) (0.44% vs. 0.5% error rate). Although\nthese error rates seem to be very small, they are quite significant. Unlike general POS\ntagging, in which it is unfair to expect an error rate of less than 2% because even human\nannotators have a disagreement rate of about 3%, sentence boundaries are much less\nambiguous (with a disagreement of about 1 in 5,000). This shows that an error rate\nof 1 in 200 (0.5%) is still far from reaching the disagreement level. On the other hand,\none error in 200 periods means that there is one error in every two documents in the\nBrown corpus and one error in every four documents in the WSJ corpus.\nWith all its strong points, there are a number of restrictions to the proposed ap-\nproach. First, in its present form it is suitable only for processing of reasonably ?well-\nbehaved? texts that consistently use capitalization (mixed case) and do not contain\nmuch noisy data. Thus, for instance, we do not expect our system to perform well\non single-cased texts (e.g., texts written in all capital or all lower-cased letters) or on\n"},{"#tail":"\n","@confidence":"0.876354","#text":"\nsentence length of 20 words equals over 3,000 words per second, but on a slower machine (DEC Alpha\n3000).\n"},{"#tail":"\n","@confidence":"0.987082342105263","#text":"\nMikheev Periods, Capitalized Words, etc.\noptical character reader?generated texts. We noted in Section 8 that very short doc-\numents of one to three sentences also present a difficulty for our approach. This is\nwhere robust syntactic systems like SATZ (Palmer and Hearst 1997) or the POS tagger\nreported in Mikheev (2000), which do not heavily rely on word capitalization and are\nnot sensitive to document length, have an advantage.\nOur DCA uses information derived from the entire document and thus can be\nused as a complement to approaches based on the local context. When we incorpo-\nrated the DCA system into a POS tagger (Section 8), we measured a 30?35% cut in the\nerror rate on proper-name identification in comparison to DCA or the POS-tagging\napproaches alone. This in turn enabled better tagging of sentence boundaries: a 0.20%\nerror rate on the Brown corpus and a 0.31% error rate on the WSJ corpus, which corre-\nsponds to about a 20% cut in the error rate in comparison to DCA or the POS-tagging\napproaches alone.\nWe also investigated the portability of our approach to other languages and ob-\ntained encouraging results on a corpus of news in Russian. This strongly suggests that\nthe DCA method can be applied to the majority of European languages, since they\nshare the same principles of capitalization and word abbreviation. Obvious exceptions,\nthough, are German and some Scandinavian languages in which capitalization is used\nfor things other than proper-name and sentence start signaling. This does not mean,\nhowever, that the DCA in general is not suitable for preprocessing of German texts?it\njust needs to be applied with different disambiguation clues.\nInitially the system described in this article was developed as a text normalization\nmodule for a named-entity recognition system (Mikheev, Grover, and Moens 1998) that\nparticipated in MUC-7. There the ability to identify proper names with high accuracy\nproved to be instrumental in enabling the entire system to achieve a very high level of\nperformance. Since then this text normalization module has been used in several other\nsystems, and its ability to be adapted easily to new domains enabled rapid develop-\nment of text analysis capabilities in medical, legal, and law enforcement domains.\nAppendix A: SBD Rule Set\nIn this section we present the rule set used by our system to assign potential sentence\nboundary punctuation as\nFS Punctuation that signals end of sentence\nAP Period that is part of abbreviation\nAFS Period that is part of abbreviation and signals end of sentence\nThis rule set operates over tokens that are disambiguated as to whether or not they\nare abbreviations and whether or not they are proper names.

For instance, the Alembic workbench (Aberdeen et al. 1995) contains a sentence-splitting module that employs over 100 regular-expression rules written in Flex. Another well-acknowledged shortcoming of rule-based systems is that such systems are usually closely tailored to a particular corpus or sublanguage and are not easily portable across domains. Automatically trainable software is generally seen as a way of producing systems that are quickly retrainable for a new corpus, for a new domain, or even for another language.

In capitalized-word disambiguation, however, we use this assumption with caution and first apply strategies that rely not just on single words but on words together with their local contexts (n-grams).

It would be misleading to infer from this evidence that the word ?Acts? is always a proper noun.? In the information extraction field, the disambiguation of ambiguous capitalized words has always been tightly linked to the classification of proper names into semantic classes such as person name, location, and company name. Named-entity recognition systems usually use sets of complex hand-crafted rules that employ a gazetteer and a local context (Krupa and Hausman 1998). In some systems such dependencies are learned from labeled examples (Bikel et al 1997). The advantage of the namedentity approach is that the system not only identifies proper names but also determines their semantic class. The disadvantage is in the cost of building a wide-coverage set of contextual clues manually or producing annotated training data. Also, the contextual clues are usually highly specific to the domain and text genre, making such systems very difficult to port. Both POS taggers and named-entity recognizers are normally built using the localcontext paradigm. In contrast, we opted for a method that relies on the entire distribution of a word in a document.

Disambiguation of capitalized words is usually handled by POS taggers, which treat capitalized words in the same way as other categories, that is, by accounting for the immediate syntactic context and using estimates collected from a training corpus. As Church (1988) rightly pointed out, however, ?Proper nouns and capitalized words are particularly problematic: some capitalized words are proper nouns and some are not. Estimates from the Brown Corpus can be misleading. For example, the capitalized word ?Acts? is found twice in the Brown Corpus, both times as a proper noun (in a title). It would be misleading to infer from this evidence that the word ?Acts? is always a proper noun.?

It has been applied not only to the identification of proper names, as described in this article, but also to their classification (Mikheev, Grover, and Moens 1998). Gale, Church, and Yarowsky (1992) showed that words strongly tend to exhibit only one sense in a document or discourse (?one sense per discourse?). Since then this idea has been applied to several tasks, including word sense disambiguation (Yarowsky 1995) and named-entity recognition (Cucerzan and Yarowsky 1999). Gale, Church, and Yarowsky?s observation is also used in our DCA, especially for the identification of abbreviations. In capitalized-word disambiguation, however, we use this assumption with caution and first apply strategies that rely not just on single words but on words together with their local contexts (n-grams).

The only reason why taggers traditionally operate on the sentence level is that a sentence naturally represents a text span in which POS information does not depend on the previous and following history. This issue can be also addressed by breaking the text into short text spans at positions where the previous tagging history does not affect current decisions.

In our experiments we applied simple linear interpolation to incorporate the DCA system into a POS tagger. Instead of decaying nonlocal information, we opted for not propagating it from one document for processing of another. For handling very long documents with our method, however, the information decay strategy seems to be the right way to proceed. Mani and MacMillan (1995) pointed out that little attention had been paid in the named-entity recognition field to the discourse properties of proper names. They proposed that proper names be viewed as linguistic expressions whose interpretation often depends on the discourse context, advocating text-driven processing rather than reliance on pre-existing lists. The DCA outlined in this article also uses nonlocal discourse context and does not heavily rely on pre-existing word lists.

This is implemented as a cascade of simple strategies, which were briefly described in Mikheev (1999). 301 Mikheev Periods, Capitalized Words, etc. 7.1 The Sequence Strategy The first DCA strategy for the disambiguation of ambiguous capitalized words is to explore sequences of words extracted from contexts in which the same words are used unambiguously with respect to their capitalization.

The best performance on the Brown corpus, a 0.2% error rate, was reported by Riley (1989), who trained a decision tree classifier on a 25-million-word corpus. In the disambiguation of capitalized words, the most widespread method is POS tagging, which achieves about a 3% error rate on the Brown corpus and a 5% error rate on the WSJ corpus, as reported in Mikheev (2000).

Incorporating DCA into a POS Tagger To test our hypothesis that DCA can be used as a complement to a local-context approach, we combined our main configuration (evaluated in row D of Table 4) with a POS tagger. Unlike other POS taggers, this POS tagger (Mikheev 2000) was also trained to disambiguate sentence boundaries. 10.1 Training a POS Tagger In our markup convention (Section 2), periods are tokenized as separate tokens regardless of whether they stand for fullstops or belong to abbreviations. Consequently a POS tagger can naturally treat them similarly to any other ambiguous words. There is, however, one difference in the implementation of such a tagger.

Since, unlike English, Russian is a highly inflected language, we had to deal with the case normalization issue. Before using the DCA method, we applied a Russian morphological processor (Mikheev and Liubushkina 1995) to convert each word in the text to its main form: nominative case singular for nouns and adjectives, infinitive for verbs, etc. For words that could be normalized to several main forms (polysemy), when secondary forms of different words coincided, we retained all the main forms.

In certain cases, however, a period denotes a decimal point or is a part of an abbreviation, and thus it does not necessarily signal a sentence boundary. Furthermore, an abbreviation itself can be the last token in a sentence in which case its period acts at the same time as part of this abbreviation and as the end-of-sentence indicator (fullstop). A detailed introduction to the SBD problem can be found in Palmer and Hearst (1997). The disambiguation of capitalized words and sentence boundaries presents a chicken-and-egg problem. If we know that a capitalized word that follows a period is a common word, we can safely assign such period as sentence terminal. On the other hand, if we know that a period is not sentence terminal, then we can conclude that the following capitalized word is a proper name.

This requires resolving sentence boundaries before tagging.

The only reason why taggers traditionally operate on the sentence level is that a sentence naturally represents a text span in which POS information does not depend on the previous and following history. This issue can be also addressed by breaking the text into short text spans at positions where the previous tagging history does not affect current decisions. For instance, a bigram tagger operates within a window of two tokens, and thus a sequence of word tokens can be terminated at an u","@endWordPosition":"10372","@position":"63533","annotationId":"T33","@startWordPosition":"10371","@citStr":"Ratnaparkhi 1996"}},"title":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"A maximum entropy model for part-of-speech Computational Linguistics Volume 28, Number 3 tagging.?"},"#tail":"\n","institution":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"University of Pennsylvania,"},"rawString":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"Ratnaparkhi, Adwait. 1996. ?A maximum entropy model for part-of-speech Computational Linguistics Volume 28, Number 3 tagging.?

The best performance on the WSJ corpus was achieved by a combination of the SATZ system (Palmer and Hearst 1997) with the Alembic system (Aberdeen et al 1995): a 0.5% error rate. The best performance on the Brown corpus, a 0.2% error rate, was reported by Riley (1989), who trained a decision tree classifier on a 25-million-word corpus. In the disambiguation of capitalized words, the most widespread method is POS tagging, which achieves about a 3% error rate on the Brown corpus and a 5% error rate on the WSJ corpus, as reported in Mikheev (2000). We are not aware of any studies devoted to the identification of abbreviations with comprehensive evaluation on either the Brown corpus or the WSJ corpus.

Training on the 300,000-word NYT text collection took about two minutes. Despite its simplicity, the performance of our approach was on the level with the previously highest reported results on the same test collections. The error rate on sentence boundaries in the Brown corpus was not significantly worse than the lowest quoted before (Riley 1989: 0.28% vs. 0.20% error rate). On the WSJ corpus our system performed slightly better than the combination of the Alembic and SATZ systems described in Palmer and Hearst (1997) (0.44% vs. 0.5% error rate). Although these error rates seem to be very small, they are quite significant. Unlike general POS tagging, in which it is unfair to expect an error rate of less than 2% because even human annotators have a disagreement rate of about 3%, sentence boundaries are much less ambiguous (with a disagreement of about 1 in 5,000).
