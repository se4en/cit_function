Since the size of problem space for syllable-to-word conversion is much less than that of syllable-to-character conversion, the most existing Chinese input systems (Hsu 1994, Hsu et al 1999, Tsai and Hsu 2002, Gao et al 2002, MSIME) are addressed on syllable-toword conversion, not syllable-to-character conversion. To the research field of Chinese speech recognition, the STW conversion is the main task of Chinese language processing in typical Chinese speech recognition systems (Fu et al 1996, Lee et al 1993, Chien et al 1993, Su et al 1992). Conventionally, there are two approaches for syllable-to-word (STW) conversion: (1) the linguistic approach based on syntax parsing, se9 mantic template matching and contextual information (Hsu 1994, Fu et al 1996, Hsu et al 1999, Kuo 1995, Tsai and Hsu 2002); and (2) the statistical approach based on the n-gram models where n is usually 2 or 3 (Lin and Tsai 1987, Gu et al 1991, Fu et al 1996, Ho et al 1997, Sproat 1990, Gao et al 2002, Lee 2003).

The UDN2001 corpus (Tsai and Hsu 2002) is a collection of 4,539,624 Chinese sentences extracted from whole 2001 articles on the United Daily News Website (UDN) in Taiwan. For this case, if the word-pair ???(China)-? ?(technique)? with the maximum frequency 26 is used to be the key word-pair, the set of cooccurrence word-pairs with the key word-pair found in the UDN2001 will be {??-??, ? ?-??, ??-??, ??-??, ??-??}. Then, by the key word-pair ???-??? and its co-occurrence word-pair set {??-??, ??- ??, ??-??, ??-??, ??-??}, the mentioned ambiguous syllable-word section (/du4ji4/yu2/ and /du4/ji4yu2/) and the homophone selection of sy
syllable-word section (/du4ji4/yu2/ and /du4/ji4yu2/) and the homophone selection of syllable-word /ji4 shu4/ (/{? ?(technique),??(count)}/) of this case can be resolved, simultaneously. Thus, the Chinese words ??? (once)?, ??? (covet)?, ??? (China)? and ???(technique)? in the syllable sequence ?yi1 du4 ji4 yu2 zhong1 guo2 de5 niang4 jiu3 ji4 shu4? can then be correctly identified.

we develop a word-pair identifier with the WP database to effectively resolve homonym and segmentation ambiguities of STW conversion on the WPrelated portion in Chinese syllables. In Section 3, we present our STW experiment results. Finally, in Section 4, we give our conclusions and suggest some future research directions. 2 Development of Word-Pair Identifier The system dictionary of our word-pair identifier is comprised of 155,746 Chinese words taken from the MOE-MANDARIN dictionary (MOE) and 29,408 unknown words auto-found in UDN2001 corpus by a Chinese word autoconfirmation (CWAC) system (Tsai et al 2003). The system dictionary provides the knowledge of words and their corresponding pinyin syllable-words. The pinyin syllable-words were translated by phoneme-to-pinyin mappings, such as ?????-to-?ji4.? 2.1 Generating the Word-Pair Database The steps of our AUTO-WP to auto-discovery word-pairs from a given Chinese sentence are as below: Step 1.

According to our previous work (Tsai et al. 2004), the word segmentation precision of BMM is about 1% greater than that of FMM. Step 2.

For the above case, there are six combinations of word-pairs extracted: {??/???, ??/???, ??/???, ?? ?/???, ???/???, ???/???}. Step 3. Final WP set: Select out the wordpairs comprised of two multi-syllabic Chinese words to be the finial WP set. For the final WP set, if the word-pair is not found in the WP database, insert it into the WP database and set its frequency to 1; otherwise, incr

Appendix A presents two cases of STW results that were obtained from the experiment. 3.4 Error Analysis of the STW Conversion We examine the Top 300 cases in the tonal and toneless STW conversion errors, respectively, from the open testing results of BiGram with the WP identifier. As per our analysis, the problems of STW conversion errors can be classified into three major types: (1) Unknown word problem: For any Chinese NLP system, unknown word extraction is one of the most difficult problems and a critical issue (Tsai et al 2003). When an error is caused only by the lack of words in the system dictionary, we call it unknown 13 word problem. (2) Inadequate syllable segmentation problem: When an error is caused by syllable-word overlapping (or say ambiguous syllableword segmentation), instead of an unknown word problem, we call it inadequate syllable segmentation. (3) Homophones problem: These are the remaining STW conversion errors. Table 4. The coverage of three problems caused the tonal and toneless STW conversion errors Problems Coverage (%) Tonal Toneless Unknown Word 12% 11% Inadequate Syllable 36% 51% Segmentatio
 the words identified by the BiGram with the WP identifier Table 4 is the coverage of the three problems. From Table 4, we have two observations: (1) The coverage of unknown word problem for tonal and toneless STW systems is similar. Since the unknown word problem is not specifically a STW problem, it can be easily taken care of through manual editing or semi-automatic learning during input. In practice, therefore, the tonal and toneless STW accuracies could be raised to 98% and 91%, respectively. Although some of unknown words have been incorporated in the system dictionary by a CWCA system (Tsai et al 2004), they could still face the problems: inadequate syllable segmentation and failed homophone disambiguation. (2) The major problem caused error conversions in tonal and toneless STW systems is different. To improve tonal STW systems, the major targets should be the cases of failed homophone selection (53% coverage). For toneless STW systems, on the other hand, the cases of inadequate syllable segmentation (51% coverage) should be the focus for improvement. To sum up the above two observations, the bottlenecks of the STW conversion lie in the second and third problems. To resolve these issues, w
