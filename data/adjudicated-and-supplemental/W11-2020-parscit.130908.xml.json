Hence, a performance metric, such as accuracy, would not be a reliable measurement. We select the unweighted average recall (UAR) to assess the model performance. Although it does not consider the severity of the error, i.e. predicting \u201c1\u201d for an IQ of \u201c5\u201d is considered as fatal as predicting \u201c4\u201d, it has been proven to be superior to other evaluation metrics, see (Higashinaka et al., 2010a), where the UAR is called Match Rate per Rating (MR/R). It is defined as follows: x 1 MR/R(R, H) = K r=1 where K is the number of classes, here \u201c5\u201d, and \u2019match\u2019 is either \u20191\u2019 or \u20190\u2019 depending on whether the classifier\u2019s hypothesis Hi for the class r matches the reference label Ri. In the course of this work we will stick to the expression MR/R by reason of clearness. We further list Cohen\u2019s n and Spearman\u2019s p to make our work comparable to other studies but will use MR/R as central evaluation criterion and for feature selection.

In the experiment, users were asked to interact with a Wizard-of-Oz restaurant information system. Each participant followed dialogues which have previously been defined following predefined scripts, i.e. specific scenarios. This resulted in equally long dialogue transcripts for each scenario. The users were constrained to rate their satisfaction on a 5-point scale with \u201cbad\u201d, \u201cpoor\u201d, \u201cfair\u201d, \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cexcellent\u201d after each dialogue step. The interaction was halted while the user voted. In a similar spirit, (Higashinaka et al., 2010a) developed a model for predicting turn-wise ratings, which was evaluated on human-machine and human-human dialogues. The data employed was not spoken dialogue but text dialogues from a chat system and a transcribed conversation between humans. The labels in the model originated from two expert raters that listened to the recorded interactions and provided turn-wise scores from 1-7 on smoothness (\u201cSmoothness of the conversation\u201d), closeness (\u201cCloseness perceived by the user towards the system\u201d) and willingness (\u201cWillingness to continue the conversation\u201d).

The best result could be achieved with a 3-gram model that reached 34% accuracy in distinguishing between six classes at any point in the dialogue. It seems that the prediction of turn-level user satisfaction scores given only one overall dialogue-level score seems hardly possible and is close to random: The prediction of the five user satisfaction classes reach an average F-score as low as 0.252, which is only 0.052 score points above the baseline of 0.20. A similar result as (Hara et al., 2010) was obtained by (Higashinaka et al., 2010b). Using HMMs they derived turn-level ratings from dialogue-wide ratings. The model\u2019s performance when trained on dialogue-level ratings was closer to random than when trained on turn-level ratings. The open issues that arise from the cited work are addressed in the following. 3 Issues Our aim is to create a general model that may be used to predict the quality of the interaction - or ideally the actual satisfaction of the user - at arbitrary system-user exchanges in an SDS.

Large influence of subjectivity - and also randomness in assigning the scores - would prevent such a general model. Consequently, it seems unavoidable to employ expert annotations. In the proper meaning of the word, the scores then do not exactly mirror the subjective impression of users but the more objective impression of expert raters. Thus we decide against the use of the term user satisfaction in the course of this work in contrast to (Higashinaka et al., 2010a) and instead opt for the expression Interaction Quality. It can be assumed that basic attitudes towards dialogue systems in general, opinions about the TTS voice, environmental factors etc. that would typically influence user satisfaction scores, and which are not of interest for our prediction, are not dominant in expert satisfaction scores in a series of annotated dialogues. Experts are expected to fade out such system-dependent and environment-dependent influences and instead focus on the dialogue behavior (i.e. the Interaction Quality) only.

Every dialogue is initially rated with a score of 5 since every interaction at the beginning can be considered as good until the opposite eventuates. Our model assumes that users are initially interacting with an SDS without bias, i.e. the basic attitude towards a dialogue system is positive. Other assumptions would not be statistically predictable. An example dialogue is depicted in Table 5 along with the ratings (cf. Figure 2 in the Appendix). (Higashinaka et al., 2010b) and (Higashinaka et al., 2010a) report low correlation among the ratings (Spearman\u2019s p 0.04-0.32), which motivated us to develop a set of basic guidelines that should be used by the raters (cf. Table 6 in the Appendix). The guidelines have been designed in such a way that the raters still have sufficient level of freedom when choosing the labels but preventing them from too strong variations among the neighboring system-user exchanges.
