Also it can be used as annotation for translation systems that automatically extract transfer\nmappings (rules or examples) from bilingual corpora. The S-SSTC is very well suited for the construction of a\nBilingual Knowledge Bank (BKB), where the examples are kept in form of S-SSTCs.\nKEYWORDS:\nparallel text, Structured String-Tree Correspondence (SSTC), Synchronous SSTC, Bilingual\nKnowledge Bank (BKB), Tree Bank Annotation Schema.\n"},{"#tail":"\n","@confidence":"0.987527271186441","#text":"\nThere is now a consensus about the fact that natural\nlanguage should be described as correspondences\nbetween different levels of representation. Much of\ntheoretical linguistics can be formulated in a very\nnatural manner as stating correspondences\n(translations) between layers of representation\nstructures (Rambow & Satta, 1996).\nIn this paper, a flexible annotation schema called\nStructured String-Tree Correspondence (SSTC)\n(Boitet & Zaharin, 1988) will be introduced to\ncapture a natural language\ntext, its corresponding\nabstract linguistic representation and the mapping\n(correspondence) between these two. The\ncorrespondence between the string and its associated\nrepresentation tree structure is defined in terms of the\nsub-correspondence between parts of the string\n(substrings) and parts of the tree structure (subtrees),\nwhich can be interpreted for both analysis and\ngeneration. Such correspondence is defined in a way\nthat is able to handle some non-standard cases (e.g.\nnon-projective correspondence).\nWhile synchronous systems are becoming more and\nmore popular, there is therefore a great need for\nformal models of corresponding different levels of\nrepresentation structures. Existing synchronous\nsystems face a problem of handling, in a\ncomputationally attractive way, some non-standard\nphenomena exist between NLs. Therefore there is a\nneed for a flexible annotation schema to realize\nadditional power and flexibility in expressing the\ndesired structural correspondences between languages\n(representation structures).\nMany problems in Machine Translation (MT), in\nparticular transfer-rules extraction, EBMT, etc., can\nbe expressed via correspondences. We will define a\nvariant of SSTC called synchronous SSTC (S-SSTC).\nS-SSTC consists of two SSTCs that are related by a\nsynchronization relation. The use of S-SSTC is\nmotivated by the desire to describe not only the\ncorrespondence between the text and its\nrepresentation structure for each language (i.e. SSTC)\nbut also the correspondence between two languages\n(synchronous correspondence). For instance, between\na language and its translation in other language in the\ncase of MT. The S-SSTC will be used to relate\nexpression of a natural language to its associated\ntranslation in another language. The interface\nbetween the two languages is made precise via a\nsynchronization relation between two SSTCs, which\nis totally non-directional.\nIn this paper, we will present the proposed S-SSTC ?\na schema well suited to describe the correspondence\nbetween two languages.

For instance, between the string in a language\nand its representation tree structure, it is important to\nspecify the sub-correspondences between parts of the\nstring (substrings) and parts of the tree structure\n(subtrees), which can be interpreted for both analysis\nand generation in NLP.

Hence, it\nis very much desired to define the correspondence in\na way to be able to handle the non-standard cases\n(e.g. non-projective correspondence), see Figure 1.\nTowards this aim, a flexible annotation structure\ncalled Structured String-Tree Correspondence (SSTC)\nwas introduced in Boitet & Zaharin (1988) to record\nthe string of terms, its associated representation\nstructure and the mapping between the two, which is\nexpressed by the sub-correspondences recorded as\npart of a SSTC.\n"},{"#tail":"\n","@confidence":"0.968587113636364","#text":"\nThe SSTC is a general structure that can associate an\narbitrary tree structure to string in a language as\ndesired by the annotator to be the interpretation\nstructure of the string, and more importantly is the\nfacility to specify the correspondence between the\nstring and the associated tree which can be non-\nprojective (Boitet & Zaharin, 1988).

An analogous\nproblem is to be defined in such a way that expresses\nthe correspondence between a language and its\ntranslations in other languages. Therefore the\nsynchronization of two adequate linguistic\nformalisms seems to be an appropriate representation\nfor that.\nThe idea of parallelized formalisms is widely used\none, and one which has been applied in many\ndifferent ways. The use of synchronous formalisms is\nmotivated by the desire to describe two languages that\nare closely related to each other but that do not have\nthe same structures. For example, synchronous Tree\nAdjoining Grammar (S-TAG) can be used to relate\nTAGs for two different languages, for example, for\nthe purpose of immediate structural translation in\nmachine translation (Abeill? et al,1990), (Harbusch\n& Poller,1996), or for relating a syntactic TAG and\nsemantic one for the same language (Shieber &\nSchabes,1990). S-TAG is a variant of Tree Adjoining\nGrammar (TAG) introduced by (Shieber &\nSchabes,1990) to characterize correspondences\nbetween tree adjoining languages. Considering the\noriginal definition of S-TAGs, one can see that it does\nnot restrict the structures that can be produced in the\nsource and target languages. It allows the construction\nof a non-TAL (Shieber, 1994), (Harbusch & Poller,\n2000). As a result, Shieber (1994) propose a restricted\ndefinition for S-TAG, namely, the IS-TAG for\nisomorphic S-TAG. In this case only TAL can be\nformed in each component. This isomorphism\nrequirement is formally attractive, but for practical\napplications somewhat too strict. Also contrastive\nwell-known translation phenomena exist in different\nlanguages, which cannot be expressed by IS-TAG,\nFigure 3 illustrates some examples (Shieber, 1994).\nSimilar limitations also appear in synchronous CFGs\n(Harbusch & Poller,1994).\nDue to these limitations, instead of investigating into\nthe synchronization of two grammars, we propose a\nflexible annotation schema (i.e. Synchronous\n"},{"#tail":"\n","@confidence":"0.887679","#text":"\nrealize additional power and flexibility in expressing\nstructural correspondences at the level of language\nsentence pairs.

For instance, the development of translation\nsystems based on transfer mappings (rules or\nexamples) that automatically extracted from these\nbilingual corpora. All these systems typically first\nobtain a tree structures (normally a predicate-\nargument or a dependency structure) for both the\nsource and target sentences. From the resulting\nstructures, lexical and structural correspondences\nbetween the two structures are extracted, which are\nthen presented as a set of examples in a bilingual\nknowledge bank (BKB) or transfer rules for\ntranslation process.\nHowever, what has so far been lacking is a schema or\na framework to annotate and express such extracted\nlexical and structural correspondences in a flexible\nand powerful manner. The proposed S-SSTC\nannotation schema can fulfill this need, and it is\nflexible enough to handle different type of relations\nthat may happen between different languages?\nstructures. S-SSTC very well suited for the\nconstruction of a BKB, which is needed for the\nEBMT applications. Al-Adhaileh and Tang (2001)\npresented an approach for constructing a BKB based\non the S-SSTC.\nIn S-SSTC, the synchronous correspondence is\ndefined in a way to ensure a flexible representation\nfor both lexical and structural correspondences: i-\nNode?to?node correspondence (lexical correspond-\nence), which is recorded in terms of pair of intervals\n(Xs,Xt) where Xs and Xt is SNODE interval/s for the\nsource and the target SSTC respectively, ii- Subtree?\nto?Subtree correspondence (structural correspond-\nence), which\nis very much needed for relating the two\ndifferent languages at a level higher than the lexical\nlevel, a level of phrases. It is recorded in terms of\npair of intervals (Ys,Yt) where Ys and Yt is STREE\ninterval/s for the source and the target SSTC\nrespectively.\nFurthermore, the SSTC structure can easily be\nextended to keep multiple levels of linguistic\ninformation, if they are considered important to\nenhance the performance of the machine translation\nsystem (i.e. Features transfer).

KEYWORDS: parallel text, Structured String-Tree Correspondence (SSTC), Synchronous SSTC, Bilingual Knowledge Bank (BKB), Tree Bank Annotation Schema. 1. INTRODUCTION There is now a consensus about the fact that natural language should be described as correspondences between different levels of representation. Much of theoretical linguistics can be formulated in a very natural manner as stating correspondences (translations) between layers of representation structures (Rambow & Satta, 1996). In this paper, a flexible annotation schema called Structured String-Tree Correspondence (SSTC) (Boitet & Zaharin, 1988) will be introduced to capture a natural language text, its corresponding abstract linguistic representation and the mapping (correspondence) between these two. The correspondence between the string and its associated representation tree structure is defined in terms of the sub-correspondence between parts of the string (substrings) and parts of the tree structure (subtrees), which can be interpreted for both analysis and generation. Such correspondence is defined in a way that is able to handle some non-standard cases (e.g. non-projective correspondence).

It is well known that many linguistic constructions are not projective (e.g. scrambling, cross serial dependencies, etc.). Hence, it is very much desired to define the correspondence in a way to be able to handle the non-standard cases (e.g. non-projective correspondence), see Figure 1. Towards this aim, a flexible annotation structure called Structured String-Tree Correspondence (SSTC) was introduced in Boitet & Zaharin (1988) to record the string of terms, its associated representation structure and the mapping between the two, which is expressed by the sub-correspondences recorded as part of a SSTC. 1 The Meaning-7H[W 7KHRU\\ 077 ZDV SXW IRUZDUG LQ ?RONRYVNL 0HO??XN  LQ WKH IUDPHZRUk of research in Machine translation. 0RUH SUHVHQWDWLRQV RI 077 FDQ EH IRXQG LQ 0HO??XN  DQG 0LOL?HYL?  2.1 The SSTC Annotation Structure The SSTC is a general structure that can associate an arbitrary tree structure to string in a language as desired by the annotator to be the interpretation structure of the stri","@endWordPosition":"835","@position":"5859","annotationId":"T4","@startWordPosition":"832","@citStr":"Boitet & Zaharin (1988)"},{"#tail":"\n","#text":": An interval of the substring in the string that corresponds to the subtree having the node N as root.

SYNCHRONOUS SSTC STRUCTURE Much of theoretical linguistics can be formulated in a very natural manner as stating correspondences (translations) between layers of representation structures (Rambow & Satta, 1996), such as the relation between syntax and semantic. An analogous problem is to be defined in such a way that expresses the correspondence between a language and its translations in other languages. Therefore the synchronization of two adequate linguistic formalisms seems to be an appropriate representation for that.

S-TAG is a variant of Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG) introduced by (Shieber & Schabes,1990) to characterize correspondences between tree adjoining languages. Considering the original definition of S-TAGs, one can see that it does not restrict the structures that can be produced in the source and target languages. It allows the construction of a non-TAL (Shieber, 1994), (Harbusch & Poller, 2000). As a result, Shieber (1994) propose a restricted definition for S-TAG, namely, the IS-TAG for isomorphic S-TAG. In this case only TAL can be formed in each component. This isomorphism requirement is formally attractive, but for practical applications somewhat too strict. Also contrastive well-known translation phenomena exist in different languages, which cannot be expressed by IS-TAG, Figure 3 illustrates some examples (Shieber, 1994).

STRUCTURED STRING-TREE CORRESPONDENCE (SSTC) From the Meaning-Text Theory (MTT)1 point of view, Natural Language (NL) is considered as a correspondence between meanings and texts (Kahane, 2001). The MTT point of view, even if it has been introduced in different formulations, is more or less accepted by the whole linguistic community. In this section, we stress on the fact that in order to describe Natural Language (NL) in a natural manner, three distinct components need to be expressed by the linguistic formalisms; namely, the text, its corresponding abstract linguistic representation and the mapping (correspondence) between these two. Actually, NL is not only a correspondence between different representation levels, as stressed by MTT postulates, but also a sub-correspondence betwe","@endWordPosition":"636","@position":"4531","annotationId":"T8","@startWordPosition":"635","@citStr":"Kahane, 2001"}},"title":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"What is a Natural Language and How to Describe It?

This explicitly indicates which word/s of the text correspond/s to which node in the tree. For describing a NL using SSTC, a set of constraints were defined to govern such correspondences (Lepage, 1994): - X:SNODE and Y:STREE intervals are governed by the following constraints: i) Global correspondence: an entire tree corresponds to an entire sentence. ii) Inclusion: a subtree which is part of another subtree T, must correspond to a substring in the substring corresponding to T. iii) Membership: a node in a subtree T, must correspond to a word which is member of the substring corresponding to T. In a similar manner, in order to describe the synchronous correspondences between NLs using SSSTC, we define a set of constraints to govern the synchronous correspondences between the different NLs.

INTRODUCTION There is now a consensus about the fact that natural language should be described as correspondences between different levels of representation. Much of theoretical linguistics can be formulated in a very natural manner as stating correspondences (translations) between layers of representation structures (Rambow & Satta, 1996). In this paper, a flexible annotation schema called Structured String-Tree Correspondence (SSTC) (Boitet & Zaharin, 1988) will be introduced to capture a natural language text, its corresponding abstract linguistic representation and the mapping (correspondence) between these two. The correspondence between the string and its associated representation tree structure is defined in terms of the sub-correspondence between parts of the string (substrings) and parts of the tree structure (subtrees), which can be interpreted for both analysis and generation. Such correspondence is defined in a way ","@endWordPosition":"257","@position":"1886","annotationId":"T17","@startWordPosition":"254","@citStr":"Rambow & Satta, 1996"},{"#tail":"\n","#text":"5) corresponds to the whole sentence ?John picks the box up?. The case depicted in Figure 2, describes how the SSTC structure treats some non-standard linguistic phenomena. The particle &quot;up&quot; is featurised into the verb &quot;pick&quot; and in discontinuous manner (e.g. &quot;up&quot; (4-5) in &quot;pick-up&quot; (1-2+4-5)) in the sentence &quot;He picks the box up&quot;. For more details on the proprieties of SSTC, see Boitet & Zaharin (1988). 3. SYNCHRONOUS SSTC STRUCTURE Much of theoretical linguistics can be formulated in a very natural manner as stating correspondences (translations) between layers of representation structures (Rambow & Satta, 1996), such as the relation between syntax and semantic. An analogous problem is to be defined in such a way that expresses the correspondence between a language and its translations in other languages. Therefore the synchronization of two adequate linguistic formalisms seems to be an appropriate representation for that. The idea of parallelized formalisms is widely used one, and one which has been applied in many different ways. The use of synchronous formalisms is motivated by the desire to describe two languages that are closely related to each other but that do not have the same structures.

S-TAG is a variant of Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG) introduced by (Shieber & Schabes,1990) to characterize correspondences between tree adjoining languages. Considering the original definition of S-TAGs, one can see that it does not restrict the structures that can be produced in the source and target languages. It allows the construction of a non-TAL (Shieber, 1994), (Harbusch & Poller, 2000). As a result, Shieber (1994) propose a restricted definition for S-TAG, namely, the IS-TAG for isomorphic S-TAG. In this case only TAL can be formed in each component. This isomorphism requirement is formally attractive, but for practical applications somewhat too strict. Also contrastive well-known translation phenomena exist in different languages, which cannot be expressed by IS-TAG, Figure 3 illustrates some examples (Shieber, 1994).

HANDLING NON-STANDARD CASES WITH S-SSTC As mentioned earlier, there are some non-standard phenomena exist between different languages, that cause challenges for synchronized formalisms. In this Section, we will describe some example cases, which are drawn from the problem of using synchronous formalisms to define translations between languages (e.g. Shieber (1994) cases). Due to lack of space we will only brief on some of these non-standard cases without going into the details.

Another case is reordering of words in the phrases, which is clear in the phrase ?thedet heavyadj boxn? and it corresponding phrase ?kotakn beratadj itudet? in the target.

STREE(N): An interval of the substring in the string that corresponds to the subtree having the node N as root. Figure 2 illustrates the sentence ?John picks the box up? with its corresponding SSTC. It contains a nonprojective correspondence. An interval is assigned to each word in the sentence, i.e. (0-1) for ?John?, (1-2) for ?picks?, (2-3) for ?the&quot;, (3-4) for ?box? and (4-5) for ?up?.

These features are very much desired in the design of an annotation scheme, in particular for the treatment of linguistic phenomena, which are non-standard, e.g. crossed dependencies (Tang & Zaharin, 1995). Definitions2: - An SSTC is a general structure, which is a string in a language associated with an arbitrary tree structure; i.e. its interpretation structure, and the correspondence between the string and its associated tree, which can be non-projective; i.e. SSTC is a triple (st, tr, co), where st is a string in one language, tr is its associated representation tree structure and co is the correspondence between st and tr. - The correspondence co between a string and its representation tree is made of two interrelated correspondences: a) Between nodes and substrings (possibly discontinuous","@endWordPosition":"991","@position":"6831","annotationId":"T29","@startWordPosition":"988","@citStr":"Tang & Zaharin, 1995"}},"title":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"Handling Crossed Dependencies with the STCG."},"booktitle":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"In Proceedings of NLPRS?95, Seoul,"},"@valid":"true","authors":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"\n","author":[{"#tail":"\n","#text":"E K Tang"},{"#tail":"\n","#text":"Y Zaharin"}]}},{"date":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"2000"},"note":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"is[va] there[ex] fire[n] hotel[n] in[prep] a[det] big[a] a[det] in[prep] Pudu Road[n] ada[va] kebakaran[n] hotel[n] di[prep] besar[a] sebuah[det] di[prep] Jalan Pudu[n] yang[det]"},"contexts":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"\n","context":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"ns also appear in synchronous CFGs (Harbusch & Poller,1994). Due to these limitations, instead of investigating into the synchronization of two grammars, we propose a flexible annotation schema (i.e. Synchronous Structured String-Tree Correspondence (S-SSTC)) to realize additional power and flexibility in expressing structural correspondences at the level of language sentence pairs. For example, such schema can serve as a mean to represent translation examples, or find structural correspondences for the purpose of transfer grammar learning (Menezes & Richardson, 2001), (Aramaki et al, 2001), (Watanabe et al, 2000), (Meyers et al, 2000), (Matsumoto et al, 1993), (kaji et al, 1992), and example-base machine translation EBMT3 (Sato & Nagao, 1990), (Sato, 1991), (Richardson et al, 2001), (Al-Adhaileh & Tang, 1999). 3.1 The Synchronous SSTC In this section, we will discuss the definition and the formal properties of S-SSTC. A S-SSTC consists of a pair of SSTCs with an additional synchronization relation between them. The use of S-SSTC is motivated by the desire to describe not only the correspondence between the text and its representation structure in one language (i.e. SSTC) but also the correspondence be","@endWordPosition":"1908","@position":"12694","annotationId":"T30","@startWordPosition":"1905","@citStr":"Watanabe et al, 2000"}},"title":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"Finding Structural Correspondences from Bilingual Parsed Corpus for Corpus-based Translation."},"volume":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"6"},"#tail":"\n","rawString":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"Watanabe H., Kurohashi S., and Aramaki E.
