We show results for combining the models for the two aforementioned subtasks into the overall task of social network extraction. We show that a combination of features from all three levels of abstractions (lexical, syntactic and semantic) are required to achieve the best performing system. 1 Introduction Social network extraction from text has recently been gaining a considerable amount of attention (Agarwal and Rambow, 2010; Elson et al., 2010; Agarwal et al., 2013a; Agarwal et al., 2013b; He et al., 2013). One of the reason for this attention, we believe, is that being able to extract social networks from unstructured text may provide a powerful new tool for historians, political scientists, scholars of literature, and journalists to analyze large collections of texts around entities and their interactions. The tool would allow researchers to quickly extract networks and assess their size, nature, and cohesiveness, a task that would otherwise be impossible with corpora numbering millions of documents. It would also make it possible to make falsifiable claims about these networks, bringing the ","@endWordPosition":"203","@position":"1299","annotationId":"T22","@startWordPosition":"200","@citStr":"He et al., 2013"},{"#tail":"\n","#text":"ntity tags to the top of the semantic tree.

However, these efforts extract a different type of network: a network of only bi-directional links, where the links are triggered by quotation marks. For example, Elson et al. (2010) and He et al.
