Then, we focused on the set of nouns having different predominant senses between the examples gathered from parallel texts and the evaluation data for the two SENSEVAL tasks. This gave a set of 6 nouns for SENSEVAL-2 and 9 nouns for SENSEVAL3. For each noun, we gathered a maximum of 500 parallel text examples as training data, similar to what we had done in (Chan and Ng, 2005b). 5 Experimental Results Similar to our previous work (Chan and Ng, 2005b), we used the supervised WSD approach described in (Lee and Ng, 2002) for our experiments, using the naive Bayes algorithm as our classifier. Knowledge sources used include partsof-speech, surrounding words, and local collocations. This approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. All accuracies reported in our experiments are micro-averages over all test examples. In (Chan and Ng, 2005b), we used a multiclass naive Bayes classifier (denoted by NB) for each word. Following this approach, we noted the WSD accuracies achieved without any adjustment, in the column L under NB in Table 1. The predictions of these naive Bayes classifiers are then used in Equation (2)","@endWordPosition":"3221","@position":"18810","annotationId":"T1","@startWordPosition":"3218","@citStr":"Lee and Ng, 2002"}},"title":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"An empirical evaluation of knowledge sources and learning algorithms for word sense disambiguation."},"booktitle":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"In Proc. ofEMNLP02."},"@valid":"true","authors":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"\n","author":[{"#tail":"\n","#text":"Yoong Keok Lee"},{"#tail":"\n","#text":"Hwee Tou Ng"}]}}}}}}
