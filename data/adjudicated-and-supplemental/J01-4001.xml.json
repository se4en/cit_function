J. Watson Research Center\nAnaphora accounts for cohesion in texts and is a phenomenon under active study\nin formal and computational linguistics alike. The correct interpretation of anaphora\nis vital for natural anguage processing (NLP). For example, anaphora resolution is\na key task in natural anguage interfaces, machine translation, text summarization,\ninformation extraction, question answering, and a number of other NLP applications.\nAfter considerable initial research, followed by years of relative silence in the early\n1980s, anaphora resolution has attracted the attention of many researchers in the last 10\nyears and a great deal of successful work on the topic has been carried out. Discourse-\noriented theories and formalisms uch as Discourse Representation Theory and Cen-\ntering Theory inspired new research on the computational treatment of anaphora. The\ndrive toward corpus-based robust NLP solutions further stimulated interest in alterna-\ntive and/or data-enriched approaches. Last, but not least, application-driven research\nin areas uch as automatic abstracting and information extraction i dependently high-\nlighted the importance of anaphora nd coreference r solution, boosting research in\nthis area.\nMuch of the earlier work in anaphora resolution heavily exploited omain and lin-\nguistic knowledge (Sidner 1979; Carter 1987; Rich and LuperFoy 1988; Carbonell and\nBrown 1988), which was difficult both to represent and to process, and which required\nconsiderable human input. However, the pressing need for the development of robust\nand inexpensive solutions to meet the demands of practical NLP systems encouraged\nmany researchers tomove away from extensive domain and linguistic knowledge and\nto embark instead upon knowledge-poor anaphora resolution strategies. A number of\nproposals in the 1990s deliberately imited the extent o which they relied on domain\nand/or linguistic knowledge and reported promising results in knowledge-poor per-\national environments (Dagan and Itai 1990, 1991; Lappin and Leass 1994; Nasukawa\n1994; Kennedy and Boguraev 1996; Williams, Harvey, and Preston 1996; Baldwin 1997;\nMitkov 1996, 1998b).\nThe drive toward knowledge-poor and robust approaches was further motivated\nby the emergence of cheaper and more reliable corpus-based NLP tools such as part-\nof-speech taggers and shallow parsers, alongside the increasing availability of corpora\nand other NLP resources (e.g., ontologies). In fact, the availability of corpora, both raw\nand annotated with coreferential links, provided a strong impetus to anaphora resolu-\n"},{"#tail":"\n","@confidence":"0.998161411764706","#text":"\ntion with regard to both training and evaluation. Corpora (especially when annotated)\nare an invaluable source not only for empirical research but also for automated learning\n(e.g., machine learning) methods aiming to develop new rules and approaches; they\nalso provide an important resource for evaluation of the implemented approaches.\nFrom simple co-occurrence rules (Dagan and Itai 1990) through training decision trees\nto identify anaphor-antecedent pairs (Aone and Bennett 1995) to genetic algorithms to\noptimize the resolution factors (Or~san, Evans, and Mitkov 2000), the successful per-\nformance of more and more modern approaches was made possible by the availability\nof suitable corpora.\nWhile the shift toward knowledge-poor strategies and the use of corpora repre-\nsented the main trends of anaphora resolution in the 1990s, there are other signifi-\ncant highlights in recent anaphora resolution research. The inclusion of the corefer-\nence task in the Sixth and Seventh Message Understanding Conferences (MUC-6 and\nMUC-7) gave a considerable impetus to the development of coreference resolution\nalgorithms and systems, such as those described in Baldwin et al (1995), Gaizauskas\nand Humphreys (1996), and Kameyama (1997). The last decade of the 20th century\nsaw a number of anaphora resolution projects for languages other than English such as\nFrench, German, Japanese, Spanish, Portuguese, and Turkish. Against the background\nof a growing interest in multilingual NLP, multilingual anaphora/coreference reso-\nlution has gained considerable momentum in recent years (Aone and McKee 1993;\nAzzam, Humphreys, and Gaizauskas 1998; Harabagiu and Maiorano 2000; Mitkov\nand Barbu 2000; Mitkov 1999; Mitkov and Stys 1997; Mitkov, Belguith, and Stys 1998).\nOther milestones of recent research include the deployment of probabilistic and ma-\nchine learning techniques (Aone and Bennett 1995; Kehler 1997; Ge, Hale, and Char-\nniak 1998; Cardie and Wagstaff 1999; the continuing interest in centering, used either\nin original or in revised form (Abra~os and Lopes 1994; Strube and Hahn 1996; Hahn\nand Strube 1997; Tetreault 1999); and proposals related to the evaluation methodology\nin anaphora resolution (Mitkov 1998a, 2001b). For a more detailed survey of the state\nof the art in anaphora resolution, see Mitkov (forthcoming).\nThe papers published in this issue reflect he major trends in anaphora resolution\nin recent years. Some of them describe approaches that do not exploit full syntactic\nknowledge (as in the case of Palomar et al's and Stuckardt's work) or that employ\nmachine learning techniques (Soon, Ng, and Lira); others present centering-based pro-\nnoun resolution (Tetreault) or discuss theoretical centering issues (Kibble). Almost all\nof the papers feature extensive valuation (including comparative valuation as in\nthe case of Tetreault's and Palomar et al's work) or discuss general evaluation issues\n(Byron as well as Stuckardt).\nPalomar et al's paper describes an approach that works from the output of a\npartial parser and handles third person personal, demonstrative, reflexive, and zero\npronouns, featuring among other things syntactic onditions on Spanish NP-pronoun\nnoncoreference and an enhanced set of resolution preferences. The authors also im-\nplement several known methods and compare their performance with that of their\nown algorithm. An indirect conclusion from this work is that an algorithm requires\nsemantic knowledge in order to hope for a success rate higher than 75%.\nSoon, Ng, and Lira describe a C5-based learning approach to coreference resolu-\ntion of noun phrases in unrestricted text. The approach learns from a small, annotated\ncorpus and tackles pronouns, proper names, and definite descriptions. The coreference\nresolution module is part of a larger coreference resolution system that also includes\nsentence segmentation, tokenization, morphological analysis, part-of-speech tagging,\nnoun phrase identification, named entity recognition, and semantic lass determina-\ntion (via WordNet). The evaluation is carried out on the MUC-6 and MUC-7 test\n"},{"#tail":"\n","@confidence":"0.998434826086956","#text":"\nMitkov, Boguraev, and Lappin Anaphora Resolution: Introduction\ncorpora. The paper reports on experiments aimed at quantifying the contribution of\neach resolution factor and features error analysis.\nStuckardt's work presents an anaphor esolution algorithm for systems where only\npartial syntactic information is available. Stuckardt applies Government and Bind-\ning Theory principles A, B, and C to the task of coreference resolution on partially\nparsed texts. He also argues that evaluation of anaphora resolution systems hould\ntake into account several factors beyond simple accuracy of resolution. In particular,\nboth developer-oriented (e.g., related to the selection of optimal resolution factors)\nand application-oriented (e.g., related to the requirement of the application, as in the\ncase of information extraction, where a proper name antecedent is needed) evaluation\nmetrics should be considered.\nTetreault's contribution features comparative valuation involving the author's\nown centering-based pronoun resolution algorithm called the Left-Right Centering\nalgorithm (LRC) as well as three other pronoun resolution methods: Hobbs's naive\nalgorithm (Hobbs 1978), BFP (Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987), and Strube's S-\nlist approach (Strube 1998). The LRC is an alternative to the original BFP algorithm in\nthat it processes utterances incrementally. It works by first searching for an antecedent\nin the current sentence; if none can be found, it continues the search on the Cf-list of\nthe previous and the other preceding utterances in a left-to-right fashion.\nIn her squib, Byron maintains that additional kinds of information should be\nincluded in an evaluation in order to make the performance of algorithms on pronoun\nresolution more transparent. In particular, she suggests that the pronoun coverage be\nexplicitly reported and proposes that the evaluation details be presented in a concise\nand compact tabular format called standard isclosure. Byron also proposes ameasure,\nthe resolution rate, which is computed as the number of pronouns resolved correctly\ndivided by the number of (only) referential pronouns.\nFinally, in his squib Kibble discusses a reformulation of the centering transitions\n(Continue, Retain, and Shift), which specify the center movement across sentences.\nInstead of defining a total preference ordering, Kibble argues that a partial ordering\nemerges from the interaction among cohesion (maintaining the same center), salience\n(realizing the center as subject), and cheapness (realizing the anticipated center of a\nfollowing utterance as subject).\nThe last years have seen considerable advances in the field of anaphora resolution,\nbut a number of outstanding issues either remain unsolved or need more attention\nand, as a consequence, represent major challenges to the further development of the\nfield (Mitkov 2001a). A fundamental question that needs further investigation is how\nfar the performance of anaphora resolution algorithms can go and what the limitations\nof knowledge-poor methods are. In particular, more research should be carried out on\nthe factors influencing the performance of these algorithms. One of the impediments\nto the evaluation or fuller utilization of machine learning techniques is the lack of\nwidely available corpora annotated for anaphoric or coreferential links. More work\ntoward the proposal of consistent and comprehensive evaluation is necessary; so too\nis work in multilingual contexts. Some of these challenges have been addressed in the\npapers published in this issue, but ongoing research will continue to address them in\nthe near future.\n"},{"#tail":"\n","@confidence":"0.777286454545455","#text":"\nComputational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 4\nacquisition of anaphora resolution\nstrategies.

Tetreault's contribution features comparative valuation involving the author's own centering-based pronoun resolution algorithm called the Left-Right Centering algorithm (LRC) as well as three other pronoun resolution methods: Hobbs's naive algorithm (Hobbs 1978), BFP (Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987), and Strube's S- list approach (Strube 1998). The LRC is an alternative to the original BFP algorithm in that it processes utterances incrementally. It works by first searching for an antecedent in the current sentence; if none can be found, it continues the search on the Cf-list of the previous and the other preceding utterances in a left-to-right fashion. In her squib, Byron maintains that additional kinds of information should be included in an evaluation in order to make the performance of algorithms on pronoun resolution more transparent.

While the shift toward knowledge-poor strategies and the use of corpora repre- sented the main trends of anaphora resolution in the 1990s, there are other signifi- cant highlights in recent anaphora resolution research. The inclusion of the corefer- ence task in the Sixth and Seventh Message Understanding Conferences (MUC-6 and MUC-7) gave a considerable impetus to the development of coreference resolution algorithms and systems, such as those described in Baldwin et al (1995), Gaizauskas and Humphreys (1996), and Kameyama (1997).

A number of proposals in the 1990s deliberately imited the extent o which they relied on domain and/or linguistic knowledge and reported promising results in knowledge-poor per- ational environments (Dagan and Itai 1990, 1991; Lappin and Leass 1994; Nasukawa 1994; Kennedy and Boguraev 1996; Williams, Harvey, and Preston 1996; Baldwin 1997; Mitkov 1996, 1998b). The drive toward knowledge-poor and robust approaches was further motivated by the emergence of cheaper and more reliable corpus-based NLP tools such as part- of-speech taggers and shallow parsers, alongside the increasing availability of corpora and other NLP resources (e.g., ontologies). In fact, the availability of corpora, both raw and annotated with coreferential links, provided a strong impetus to anaphora resolu- * School of Humanities, Language and Social Sciences, Stafford Street, Wolve","@endWordPosition":"319","@position":"2231","annotationId":"T27","@startWordPosition":"318","@citStr":"Nasukawa 1994"}},"title":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"Robust method of pronoun resolution using full-text information."},"booktitle":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"In Proceedings ofthe 15th International Conference on Computational Linguistics (COLING'94),"},"@valid":"true","authors":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"\n","author":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"Tetsuya Nasukawa"}}},{"#tail":"\n","date":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"2000"},"rawString":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"Or~san, Constantin, Richard Evans, and Ruslan Mitkov. 2000.

Tetreault's contribution features comparative valuation involving the author's own centering-based pronoun resolution algorithm called the Left-Right Centering algorithm (LRC) as well as three other pronoun resolution methods: Hobbs's naive algorithm (Hobbs 1978), BFP (Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987), and Strube's S- list approach (Strube 1998). The LRC is an alternative to the original BFP algorithm in that it processes utterances incrementally. It works by first searching for an antecedent in the current sentence; if none can be found, it continues the search on the Cf-list of the previous and the other preceding utterances in a left-to-right fashion. In her squib, Byron maintains that additional kinds of information should be included in an evaluation in order to make the performance of algorithms on pronoun resolution more transparent. In particular, she suggests that the pronoun coverage be explicitly reported and proposes that","@endWordPosition":"1227","@position":"8526","annotationId":"T30","@startWordPosition":"1226","@citStr":"Strube 1998"}},"title":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"Never look back: An alternative to centering."},"booktitle":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"In Proceedings of the 36th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and the 17th International Conference on Computational Linguistics (COLING'98/ACL'98),"},"@valid":"true","authors":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"\n","author":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"Michael Strube"}}},{"#tail":"\n","date":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"1996"},"rawString":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"Strube, Michael and Udo Hahn. 1996.
