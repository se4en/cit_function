Instead, the NLP community has focused on issues such as highlighting key sentences in papers (Sandor and Vorndran, 2009), detecting important feedback features in reviews (Cho, 2008; Xiong and Litman, 2010), and adapting peer-review assignment (Garcia, 2010). However, many NLP studies have been done on the helpfulness of other types of reviews, such as product reviews (Kim et al., 2006; Ghose and Ipeirotis, 2010), movie reviews (Liu et al., 2008), book reviews (Tsur and Rappoport, 2009), etc. Kim et al. (2006) used regression to predict the helpfulness ranking of product reviews based on various classes of linguistic features. Ghose and Ipeirotis (2010) further examined the socio-economic impact of product reviews using a similar approach and suggested the usefulness of subjectivity analysis. Another study (Liu et al., 2008) of movie reviews showed that helpfulness depends on reviewers\u2019 expertise, their writing style, and the timeliness of the review.

For our study, we will also compute the average ratings given by the two experts, yielding four types of possible gold-standard ratings of peer-review helpfulness for each review. Figure 1 shows the rating distribution of each type. Interestingly, we observed that expert ratings roughly follow a normal distribution, while students are more likely to give higher ratings (as illustrated in Figure 1). 4 Features Our features are motivated by the prior work introduced in Section 2, in particular, NLP work on predicting product-review helpfulness (Kim et al., 2006), as well as work on automatically learning cognitive-science constructs (Nelson and Schunn, 2009) using NLP (Cho, 2008; Xiong and Litman, 2010). The complete list of features is shown in Table 3 and described below. The computational linguistic features are automatically extracted based on the output of syntactic analysis of reviews and papers3. These features represent structural, lexical, syntactic and semantic information of the textual content, and also include information for identifying certain important cognitive constructs: \u2022 Structural features consider the general structure of revie","@endWordPosition":"1717","@position":"10978","annotationId":"T3","@startWordPosition":"1714","@citStr":"Kim et al., 2006"},{"#tail":"\n","#text":", maybe, try, revision, want LOC location page, paragraph, sentence ERR problem error, mistakes, typo, problem, difficulties, conclusion IDE idea verb consider, mention LNK transition however, but NEG negative words fail, hard, difficult, bad, short, little, bit, poor, few, unclear, only, more POS positive words great, good, well, clearly, easily, effective, effectively, helpful, very SUM summarization main, overall, also, how, job NOT negation not, doesn\u2019t, don\u2019t SOL solution revision specify correction Table 1: Ten lexical categories Compared with commonly used lexical unigrams and bigrams (Kim et al., 2006), these lexical categories are equally useful in modeling peer-review helpfulness, and significantly reduce the feature space.4 \u2022 Syntactic features mainly focus on nouns and verbs, and include percentage of tokens that are nouns, verbs, verbs conjugated in the first person (1stPUerb%), adjectives/adverbs, and open classes, respectively. \u2022 Semantic features capture two important peer4Lexical categories help avoid the risk of over-fitting, given only 189 peer reviews in our case compared to more than ten thousand Amazon.com reviews used for predicting product review helpfulness (Kim et al., 200","@endWordPosition":"2041","@position":"13140","annotationId":"T4","@startWordPosition":"2038","@citStr":"Kim et al., 2006"},{"#tail":"\n","#text":"), however, peer-review helpfulness is rated at the review level.7 Our cognitive-science features aggregate the annotations up to the review-level by reporting the percentage of idea-units in a review that exhibit each characteristic: the distribution of review types (praise%, problem%, summary%), the percentage of problemlocalized critiques (localization%), as well as the percentage of solution-provided ones (solution%). \u2022 Social-science features introduce elements reflecting interactions between students in a peerreview assignment. As suggested in related work on product review helpfulness (Kim et al., 2006; Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al., 2009), some social dimensions (e.g. customer opinion on related product quality) are of great influence in the perceived helpfulness of product reviews. Similarly, in our case, we introduced related paper ratings (pRating) \u2014 to consider whether and how helpfulness ratings are affected by the rating that the paper receives8 \u2014 and the absolute difference between the rat7Details of different granularity levels of annotation can be found in (Nelson and Schunn, 2009). 8That is, to examine whether students give higher ratings to peers who gave them higher paper rati","@endWordPosition":"2706","@position":"17548","annotationId":"T5","@startWordPosition":"2703","@citStr":"Kim et al., 2006"}]},"title":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"Automatically assessing review helpfulness."},"booktitle":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"In Proceedings of the 2006 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP2006),"},"@valid":"true","authors":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"\n","author":[{"#tail":"\n","#text":"Soo-Min Kim"},{"#tail":"\n","#text":"Patrick Pantel"},{"#tail":"\n","#text":"Tim Chklovski"},{"#tail":"\n","#text":"Marco Pennacchiotti"}]}},{"#tail":"\n","date":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"2011"},"rawString":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"Wenting Xiong and Diane Litman. 2011.
