wn QA-Token, and built an IR system which deviates from the traditional model in three important aspects. • We process the query against a set of approximately 200 question templates which, may replace some of the query words with a set of QA-Tokens, called a SYNclass. Thus &quot;Where&quot; gets mapped to &quot;PLACE$&quot;, but &quot;How long &quot; goes to &quot;@SYN(LENGTHS, DURATIONS)&quot;. Some templates do not cause complete replacement of the matched string. For example, the pattern &quot;What is the population&quot; gets replaced by &quot;NUMBER$ population&quot;. • Before indexing the text, we process it with Textract (Byrd and Ravin, 1998; Wacholder et al., 1997), which performs lemmatization, and discovers proper names and technical terms. We added a new module (Resporator) which annotates text segments with QA-Tokens using pattern matching. Thus the text &quot;for 5 centuries&quot; matches the DURATION$ pattern &quot;for :CARDINAL _timeperiod&quot;, where :CARDINAL is the label for cardinal numbers, and _timeperiod marks a time expression. • GuruQA scores text passages instead of documents. We use a simple documentand collection-independent weighting scheme: QA-Tokens get a weight of 400, proper nouns get 200 and any other word - 100 (stop words are removed in query pr
