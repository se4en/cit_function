Where Zhang et al choose for sparse priors (leading to sharp phrase distributions) and put the smoothing burden on the ITG rule parameters and a pruning strategy, we choose for a prior over segmentations determined by the ITG derivation space and smooth the MLE directly with a penalized version of Deleted Estimation. It remains to be seen how the two biases compare to one another on the same task. There are various strands of future research. Firstly, we plan to explore our estimator on other language pairs in order to obtain more evidence on its behavior. Secondly, as (Blunsom et al., 2008) show, marginalizing out the different segmentations during decoding leads to improved performance. We plan to build our own decoder (based on ITG) where different ideas can be tested including tractable ways for achieving a marginalization effect. Apart from a new decoder, it will be worthwhile adapting the prior probability in our model to allow for consistent estimation. Finally, it would be interesting to study properties of the penalized Deleted Estimation used in this paper.

While this heuristic estimator gives good empirical results, it does not seem to optimize any intuitively reasonable objective function of the (wordaligned) parallel corpus (see e.g., (DeNero et al., 2006)) The mounting number of efforts attacking this problem over the last few years (DeNero et al., 2006; Marcu and Wong, 2002; Birch et al., 2006; Moore and Quirk, 2007; Zhang et al., 2008) exhibits its difficulty.

Within a Maximum-Likelihood estimator, preference for segmentations al consisting of longer containers could lead to overfitting as we will explain in section 4. Alternatively, it is tempting to have preference for segmentations at that consist of shorter containers, because (generally speaking) shorter containers have higher expected coverage of new sentence pairs.
