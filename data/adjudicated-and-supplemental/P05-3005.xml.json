One requirement for\nNLP is the ability to accurately recognize terms that\nrepresent biological entities in free text. Another re-\nquirement is the ability to associate these terms with\ncorresponding biological entities (i.e., records in bio-\nlogical databases) in order to be used by other auto-\nmated systems for literature mining. Such task is\ncalled biological entity tagging. Biological entity\ntagging is not a trivial task because of several charac-\nteristics associated with biological entity names,\nnamely: synonymy (i.e., different terms refer to the\nsame entity), ambiguity (i.e., one term is associated\nwith different entities), and coverage (i.e., entity\nterms or entities are not present in databases or\nknowledge bases).\nMethods for biological entity tagging can be catego-\nrized into two types: one is to use a dictionary and a\nmapping method [3-5], and the other is to markup\nterms in the text according to contextual cues, spe-\ncific verbs, or machine learning [6-10]. The per-\nformance of biological entity tagging systems using\ndictionaries depends on the coverage of the diction-\nary as well as mapping methods that can handle syn-\nonymous or ambiguous terms. Strictly speaking,\ntagging systems that do not use dictionaries are not\nbiological entity tagging but biological term tagging,\nsince tagged terms in text are not associated with\nspecific biological entities stored in databases. It re-\nquires an additional step to map terms mentioned in\nthe text to records in biological databases in order to\nbe automatically integrated with other system or da-\ntabases. Due to the dynamic nature associated with\nthe molecular biology domain, it is critical to have a\ncomprehensive biological entity dictionary that is\nalways up-to-date.\nIn this paper, we present a system that constructs a\nlarge protein entity dictionary, BioThesaurus, using\nonline resources. Terms in the dictionary are then\ncurated based on high ambiguous terms to flag non-\nsensical terms (e.g., Novel protein) and are also cu-\nrated based on the semantic categories acquired from\nthe UMLS to flag descriptive terms that associate\nwith other semantic types other than gene or proteins\n(e.g., terms that refer to species, cells or other small\nmolecules).
