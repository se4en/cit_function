The DM features also include running tallies for the number of reprompts (num-reprompts), number of confirmation prompts (num-confirms), and number of subdialogue prompts (num-subdials), that had been played up to each point in the dialogue, as well as running percentages (percent-reprompts, percent. confirms, percent-subdials). The use of running tallies and percentages is based on the assumption that these features are likely to produce generalized predictors (Litman et al., 1999). The features obtained via hand-labelling were human transcripts of each user utterance (tscript), a set of semantic labels that are closely related to the system task-type labels (human-label), age (age) and gender (gender) of the user, the actual modality of the user utterance (user-modality) (one of: nothing, speech, touchtone, speech+touchtone, non-speech), 213 and a cleaned transcript with non-word noise information removed (clean-tscript). From these features we calculated two derived features. The first was the number of words in the cleaned transcript (cltscript numwords), again on th","@endWordPosition":"3184","@position":"19148","annotationId":"T1","@startWordPosition":"3181","@citStr":"Litman et al., 1999"},{"#tail":"\n","#text":"on in error rate relative to the automatic features. Even with current accuracy rates, the improved ability to predict problematic dialogues means that it may be possible to field the system without human agent oversight, and we expect to be able to improve these results. The research reported here is the first that we know of to automatically analyze a corpus of logs from a spoken dialogue system for the purpose of learning to predict problematic situations. Our work builds on earlier research on learning to identify dialogues in which the user experienced poor speech recognizer performance (Litman et al., 1999). However, that work was based on a much smaller set of experimental dialogues where the notion of a good or bad dialogue was automatically approximated rather than being labelled by humans. In addition, because that work was based on features synthesized over the entire dialogues, the hypotheses that were learned could not be used for prediction during runtime. We are exploring several ways to improve the performance of and test the problematic dialogue predictor. First, we noted above the extent to which the hand-labelled feature rsuccess improves classifier performance.
