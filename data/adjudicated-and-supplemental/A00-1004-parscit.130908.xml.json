In CUR, the quality requirement for translation is relatively low. For example, the syntactic aspect is irrelevant. Even if the translated word is not a true translation but is strongly related to the original query, it is still helpful. Therefore, CUR is a suitable application for such a translation model. However, a major obstacle to this approach is the lack of parallel corpora for model training. Only a few such corpora exist, including the Hansard English-French corpus and the HKUST EnglishChinese corpus (Wu, 1994). In this paper, we will describe a method which automatically searches for parallel texts on the Web. We will discuss the text mining algorithm we adopted, some issues in translation model training using the generated parallel corpus, and finally the translation model's performance in CUR. 2 Parallel Text Mining Algorithm The PTMiner system is an intelligent Web agent that is designed to search for large amounts of parallel text on the Web. The mining algorithm is largely language independent. It can thus be adapted to other language pairs with only minor modifications.

As we can see in Fig. 3, the cognate method did not make the same mistake because of the noise in sentence 0002. Despite their large length difference, the two 0002 sentences are still aligned as a 1-1 pair, because the sentences in the following 4 alignments (0003 - 0003; 0004 - 0004, 0005; 0005 - 0006; 0006 - 0007) have rather similar HTML markups and are taken by the program to be the most likely alignments. Beside HTML markups, other criteria may also be incorporated. For example, it would be helpful to consider strong correspondence between certain English and Chinese words, as in (Wu, 1994). We hope to implement such correspondences in our future research. 3.4 Lexicon Evaluation To evaluate the precision of the English-Chinese translation model trained on the Web corpus, we examined two sample lexicons of 200 words, one in each direction. The 200 words for each lexicon were randomly selected from the training source. We examined the most probable translation for each word. The Chinese-English lexicon was found to have a precision of 77%. The English-Chinese lexicon has a higher precision of 81.5%. Part of the lexicons are shown in Fig. 4, where t/f indicates whether a translatio","@endWordPosition":"3114","@position":"19430","annotationId":"T5","@startWordPosition":"3113","@citStr":"Wu, 1994"}]},"title":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"Aligning a parallel EnglishChinese corpus statistically with lexical criteria."},"booktitle":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"In ACL-94: 32nd Annual Meeting of the Assoc. for Computational Linguistics,"},"@valid":"true","authors":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"\n","author":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"Dekai Wu"}}}]}}}}
