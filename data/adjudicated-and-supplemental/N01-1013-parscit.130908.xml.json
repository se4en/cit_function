One condition that is likely to be violated is the requirement that expected values in the contingency table should not be too small. (A rule of thumb often found in text books is that the expected values should be greater than 5.) One response to this problem is to apply some kind of thresholding, and either ignore counts below the threshold, or only apply the test to tables that do not contain low counts. The problem with this approach is that any threshold is, to some extent, arbitrary, and there is evidence to suggest that, for some tasks, low counts are important (Collins and Brooks, 1995). Another approach would be to use Fisher's exact test, which can be applied to tables regardless of the size of the counts. The main problem with this test is that it is computationally expensive, especially for large contingency tables (and it only applies to tables with whole number counts). What we have found in practice is that applying the chi-squared test to tables with low counts tends to produce an insignificant result, and the null hypothesis is not rejected. The consequences of this for the generalisation procedure are that low count tables tend to result in the procedure moving up ","@endWordPosition":"2351","@position":"13232","annotationId":"T1","@startWordPosition":"2348","@citStr":"Collins and Brooks, 1995"}},"title":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"Prepositional phrase attachment through a backedoff model."},"booktitle":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"In Proceedings of the Third Workshop on Very Large Corpora,"},"@valid":"true","authors":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"\n","author":[{"#tail":"\n","#text":"M Collins"},{"#tail":"\n","#text":"J Brooks"}]}},{"#tail":"\n","date":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"1993"},"rawString":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"T.
