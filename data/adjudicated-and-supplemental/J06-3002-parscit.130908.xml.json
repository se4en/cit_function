Based on examples of this sort, recent approaches have formalized the problem of disambiguating PP attachments as a binary choice, distinguishing between attachment of a PP to a given verb or to the verb\u2019s direct object (Hindle and Rooth 1993; Ratnaparkhi, Reynar, and Roukos 1994; Collins and Brooks 1995; Merlo, Crocker, and Berthouzoz 1997; Stetina and Nagao 1997; Ratnaparkhi 1997; Zhao and Lin 2004).

The developers of PropBank integrate the difference between arguments and adjuncts directly into the level of specificity of their annotation. They adopt labels that are common across verbs for adjuncts. They inherit these labels from the Penn Treebank annotation. Arguments are annotated instead with labels specific to each verb (Xue 2004; Palmer, Gildea, and Kingsbury 2005). From a quantitative point of view, arguments and adjuncts have different statistical properties. For example, Hindle and Rooth (1993) clearly indicate that their lexical association technique performs much better for arguments than for adjuncts, whether the attachment is to the verb or to the noun.

In a previous attempt to capture this notion, we approximated by simply measuring the cardinality of the set of heads that co-occur with a given PP in a corpus, as indicated in equation (6).
