We show for the first time that self-training is able to significantly improve the performance of the PCFG-LA parser, a single generative parser, on both small and large amounts of labeled training data. Our approach achieves stateof-the-art parsing accuracies for a single parser on both English (91.5%) and Chinese (85.2%). 1 Introduction There is an extensive research literature on building high quality parsers for English (Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000; Charniak and Johnson, 2005; Petrov et al., 2006), however, models for parsing other languages are less well developed. Take Chinese for example; there have been several attempts to develop accurate parsers for Chinese (Bikel and Chiang, 2000; Levy and Manning, 2003; Petrov and Klein, 2007), but the state-of-the-art performance, around 83% F measure on Penn Chinese Treebank (achieved by the Berkeley parser (Petrov and Klein, 2007)) falls far short of performance on English (∼90-92%). As pointed out in (Levy and Manning, 2003), there are many linguistic differences between Chinese and English, as well as structural diffe","@endWordPosition":"162","@position":"1125","annotationId":"T1","@startWordPosition":"159","@citStr":"Charniak and Johnson, 2005"},{"#tail":"\n","#text":"Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 832\u2013841, Singapore, 6-7 August 2009. c�2009 ACL and AFNLP was trained on a small labeled set. Reichart and Rappoport (2007) obtained significant gains using Collins lexicalized parser with a different selftraining protocol, but again they only looked at small labeled sets. McClosky et al. (2006) effectively utilized unlabeled data to improve parsing accuracy on the standard WSJ training set, but they used a two-stage parser comprised of Charniak\u2019s lexicalized probabilistic parser with n-best parsing and a discriminative reranking parser (Charniak and Johnson, 2005), and thus it would be better categorized as \u201cco-training\u201d (McClosky et al., 2008). It is worth noting that their attempts at selftraining Charniak\u2019s lexicalized parser directly resulted in no improvement. There are other successful semi-supervised training approaches for dependency parsing, such as (Koo et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2008), and it would be interesting to investigate how they could be applied to constituency parsing.
