On the one hand, the separation of planning and linguistic realization into distinct components seems natural and useful. On the other hand, it precludes making decisions involving interactions between text planning and linguistic issues. One possible response would be to abandon the separation; the generator could be a single component that handles all of the work. This approach has occasionally been taken, as in Kantrowitz and Bates (1992) and Danlos (1987) and, at least implicitly, in Paris and Scott (1994) and Delin et al. (1994); however, under this approach, all of the flexibility and simplicity of modular design is lost. The opposite approach is to simply ignore the limitations of a modular design and proceed as if there need be no interactions between the components. Whatever problems result will be handled as best they can, on a case-by-case basis. This approach is the one taken (implicitly or explicitly) in the majority of generators. In fact, Reiter has even argued in favor of this approach, claiming that the interactions are sufficiently minor to be ignored (or at least handled on an ad","@endWordPosition":"2550","@position":"16174","annotationId":"T37","@startWordPosition":"2547","@citStr":"Paris and Scott (1994)"}},"title":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"Intentions, structure and expression in multi-lingual instructions."},"booktitle":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"In Proceedings of the Seventh International Workshop on Natural Language Generation,"},"@valid":"true","authors":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"\n","author":[{"#tail":"\n","#text":"C6cile L Paris"},{"#tail":"\n","#text":"Donia R Scott"}]}},{"#tail":"\n","date":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"1994"},"rawString":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"Reiter, Ehud. 1994.
