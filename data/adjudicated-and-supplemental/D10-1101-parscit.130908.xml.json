A recurring problem, which arises when working with supervised approaches, concerns the domain portability. In the opinion mining context this question has been prominently investigated with respect to opinion polarity analysis (sentiment analysis) in previous research (Aue and Gamon, 2005; Blitzer et al., 2007). Terms as \u201cunpredictable\u201d can express a positive opinion when uttered about the storyline of a movie but a negative opinion when the handling of a car is described. Hence the effects of training and testing a machine learning algorithm for sentiment analysis on data from different domains have been analyzed in previous research. However to the best of our knowledge, these effects have not been investigated regarding the extraction of opinion targets. The contribution of this paper is a CRF-based approach for opinion targets extraction which tackles the problem of domain portability.

They observe that increasing the amount of training data raises the classification accuracy, but only if the training data is from one source domain. Increasing the training data by mixing domains does not yield any consistent improvements. Blitzer et al. (2007) introduce an extension to a structural correspondence learning algorithm, which was specifically designed to address the task of domain adaptation. Their enhancement aims at identifying pivot features, which are stable across domains. In a series of experiments in document level sentiment classification they show that their extension outperforms the original structural correspondence learning approach.

In isolation, training only on the cars data yields the second highest results on the movies and webservices datasets and the highest results regarding F-Measure on the cameras data. However, the results of the cars + cameras training data combination indicate that the cameras data does not contribute any additional information during the learning, since the results on both the movies and the web-services datasets are lower than when training only on the cameras data. Our results also confirm the insights gained by Blitzer et al. (2007), who observed that in crossdomain polarity analysis adding more training data is not always beneficial. Apparently even the smallest training dataset (cameras) contain enough feature instances to learn a model which performs well on the testing data. We observe that the results of the cross-domain extraction regarding F-Measure come relatively close to the results of the single-domain setting, especially if the token string feature is removed there (see Table 3 row 9). On the cars and the cameras dataset the cross-domain results are even closer to the single-domain results.
