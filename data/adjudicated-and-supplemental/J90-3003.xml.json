F i tzpat r ick\nAT & T Bell Laboratories\nMurray Hill, NJ 07974\nWe describe an experimental text-to-speech system that uses information about syntactic constituency,\nadjacency to a verb, and constituent length to determine prosodic phrasing for synthetic speech. A central\ngoal of our work has been to characterize &quot;discourse neutral&quot; phrasing, i.e. sentence-level phrasing patterns\nthat are independent of discourse semantics. Our account builds on Bachenko et al (1986), but differs in its\ntreatment of clausal structure and predicate-argument relations. Results so far indicate that the current\nsystem performs well when measured against a corpus of judgments of prosodic phrasing.\n"},{"#tail":"\n","@confidence":"0.999523784615385","#text":"\nIn previous work (Bachenko et al 1986), we described an\nexperimental text-to-speech system that determined pro-\nsodic phrasing for the Olive-Liberman synthesizer (Olive\nand Liberman 1985). The system generated phrase bound-\naries using information derived from the syntactic struc-\nture of a sentence. While we saw significant improvements\nin the resulting synthesized speech, we also observed prob-\nlems with the system. Often these stemmed from our\nassumptions that both clausal structure and predicate-\nargument relations were important in determining prosodic\nphrasing. This paper reconsiders those assumptions and\ndescribes an analysis of phrasing that we believe corrects\nmany of the problems of the earlier version. Like the earlier\nversion, it has been implemented in a text-to-speech system\nthat uses a natural language parser and prosody rules to\ngenerate information about the location and relative\nstrength of prosodic phrase boundaries.\nOur current analysis rests on two ideas. First, it is\npossible to describe a level of prosodic phrasing that is\nindependent ofdiscourse semantics. Second, this discourse-\nneutral phrasing depends on a mix of syntactic and nonsyn-\ntactic factors; chiefly, syntactic onstituency, left-to-right\nword order, and constituent length. There is no necessary fit\nbetween syntactic structure and phrasing, since prosodic\nphrasing may ignore major syntactic boundaries in order to\nsatisfy the constraints on phrase length. Our approach thus\nfollows that of Grosjean et al (1979), namely, that phras-\ning reflects &quot; . . . two (sometimes conflicting) demands on\nthe speaker: the need to respect he linguistic structure of\nthe sentence and the need to balance the length of the\nconstituents in the output&quot; (p. 75).\nSection 2 will outline our analysis, focusing on the rela-\ntionship between syntactic and prosodic structure. The\nanalysis is developed within the framework of generative\ngrammar, but we believe it is consistent with other ap-\nproaches to syntactic description. 1 Our main point will be\nthat the syntax plays a necessary but not sufficient role in\ndetermining phrasing, its effects being filtered by separate\nconditions on prosodic well-formedness (e.g. length). Sec-\ntion 3 describes the implementation of our analysis in an\nexperimental text-to-speech system, and Section 4 summa-\nrizes our main conclusions. Unless otherwise noted, the\ncorpus we used as a source of observations on phrasing in\nhuman speech consisted of a taped professional dramatiza-\ntion of the Sherlock Holmes story The Speckled Band and\na documentary about Mount Everest that includes both\nprofessional &quot;prepared&quot; narration and the spontaneous\nspeech of interviews. The Holmes story involved two male\nspeakers and one female speaker; the Everest documentary\ninvolved a male narrator and several male interviewees.\nBoth of us independently transcribed the tapes according to\nour perceptions ofprosodic phrasing. Other examples come\nfrom transcriptions of speech that we recorded at Bell\nLaboratories. In the transcriptions, we both distinguished\nthree types of prosodic event: a primary phrase boundary, a\nsecondary phrase boundary, and the absence of a boundary.\nThe most salient characteristic of the primary phrase bound-\nary was a pause, while that of the secondary boundary\ninvolved a change in pitch. In comparing the two transcrip-\ntions, we discarded cases in which there was a discrepancy\nbetween the two markings, which left us with a corpus of\napproximately 500 sentences against which the prosodic\nphrasing rules were tested.\nComputational Linguistics Volume 16, Number 3, September 1990 155\nJ.

This observation has led some researchers,\ne.g., Cooper and Paccia-Cooper (1980), to claim a direct\nmapping between the syntactic phrase and the prosodic\nphra,;e. However, this claim is controversial because of the\nmisa'dgnments that occur between the two levels of phras-\ning. For example, in considering the connection between\nsyntax and phrasing, the linguistic literature most often\nrefers to examples of embedded sentences. Sentences like\n12, from Chomsky (1965), are frequently cited. (Square\nbrackets mark off the NP constituents hat contain embed-\nded sentences.)\n12. This is \\[uP the cat that caught \\[NP the rat that stole \\[NP\nthe cheese\\]\\]\\]\nIn such cases, the syntactic onstituency indicated by brack-\neting is not in alignment with the prosodic phrasing. In-\nstead, 12 has the prosodic phrasing in 13a. The phrasing in\n13b, which most closely matches constituency, is strange at\nbest. (In these and other examples, the most prominent\nprosodic boundaries are marked by vertical bars.)\n13. a. This is the cat II that caught he rat 1\\[ that stole the\ncheese,\nb. ??This is II the cat that caught II the rat that stole \\[\\[\nthe cheese.\nTo account for such mismatches, &quot;readjustment rules&quot; that\nchange constituent structure by adjoining each embedded\nsente, nce to the node dominating it have been posited. The\nresult is a flattened structure that more accurately reflects\nthe prosodic phrasing. In Chomsky and Halle (1968), this\nflattening process is not part of the grammar. Rather, it is\nviewed as &quot; . . . a performance factor, related to the diffi-\nculty of producing right branching structures such as \\[ 12\\]&quot;\n(p. 372). Thus phrasing, in their approach, is only indi-\nrectly related to syntax, since readjustment is done by\nspecial rules outside the grammar proper.\nLangendoen (1975) proposes readjustment rules similar\nto those of Chomsky and Halle, but he claims that the\nreadjustment of structure is part of the grammar, not part\nof the performance model. He thus makes explicit what is\noften a tacit assumption i both the linguistic and psycho-\nlinguistic literature2--that there is a direct connection\nbetween syntactic onstituency and prosodic phrasing, with\napparent misalignments readjusted before syntax inter-\nface,; with prosodic phonology.\nLangendoen's proposal works well for sentences such as\n12 because it predicts that important prosodic phrase bound-\naries will coincide with sentence boundaries. But this does\nnot always fit the prosodic facts--sentences that lack overt\ncomplementizers or relative pronouns often resist he inser-\ntion of a break to set them off. For example, when applied\nto They believe California sales are still off 75 percent,\nreadjustment rules cause the embedded sentence to be set\noff prosodically, as in 14a. This seems quite unnatural\ncompared with 14b (an observed example), where a bound-\nary has been inserted not before the sentence, but after the\nembedded subject.\n156 Compur, ational Linguistics Volume 16, Number 3, September 1990\nJ.

But in our data, this sentence\nactually has the phrasing in 15b, where the relative clause\nis not set off. (The relative clause in these examples is\nitalicized.)\n15. a. ??It was ready to bite the first person I\\] it saw.\nb. It was ready to bite \\[I the first person it saw.\nMoreover, there are certain distinctions among clause types,\nfor example the difference between restrictive and apposi-\ntive relatives, that are captured only by the presence or\nabsence of a separate prosodic phrase for the clause. How-\never, Langendoen's claim that embedded clauses are flat-\ntened would nullify this difference. The flattening and\nconsequent setting off of restrictive relatives would render\nsentences such as 16a unintelligible because the associated\nappositive reading forces a contradiction between who\ncame from Plymouth and who came from Falmouth. We\nbelieve the only intelligible version of this sentence is 16b,\nwhere there has been no readjustment of the come from\nclauses.\n16. a. ??The pilgrims \\]\\[ who came from Plymouth 1\\] were a\nlusty bunch 1\\] while the pilgrims \\[\\] who came from\nFalmouth II were not.\nb.

Even at the level of prosodic phras-\ning, syntactic onstituents often cohere. Where misalign-\nments between the syntactic and the prosodic phrasing\noccur, however, the notion of readjusting the syntax to fit\nthe prosody is problematic and, we believe, compares unfa-\nvorably with an approach that views the semantic and\nphonological components a contributing to prosodic phrase\nboundary determination.\n"},{"#tail":"\n","@confidence":"0.988050058823529","#text":"\nThe syntax/prosody misalignment may be viewed as result-\ning in part from semantic onsiderations.

Bing also observes that\nconstituents that refer to items newly introduced into a\ndiscourse tend to be longer. This may be the reason that\nword count and syllable count play a prominent role in\nprosodic phrasing (see Section 2.1.3.).

On the other hand, Bing's\nwork gives a broader picture of the relation between dis-\ncourse and phrasing, but it deals only with noun phrases.\nThus both of these efforts leave open the question as to\nwhether discourse features completely determine prosodic\nphrasing or are a complement to some more basic set of\ndeterminants, syntactic and/or phonological. In other words,\nwhen prosodic features that reflect facts of the discourse\nare removed, is there a residual, neutral phrasing?\nOur work on the prosodic phrase status of clause final\nprepositional phrases, which we discuss below, suggests the\nexistence of a discourse-neutral phrasing that depends on\nsyntactic onstituency mediated by string adjacency and\nlength of a potential prosodic phrase. 3 Such phrasing pro-\nvides us with a typical phrasing pattern analogous to the\ntypical phrasal stress patterns examined in Liberman and\nPrince (1977), which &quot;are often overwhelmed by the chiar-\noscuro of highlight and background in discourse, but retain\nthe status of null-hypothesis patterns that emerge when\nComputational Linguistics Volume 16, Number 3, September 1990 157\nJ.

Thus in our analysis, rules of phonological word\nformation apply to the non-null terminal nodes in a syntax\ntree. If the terminal is a content word, i.e. noun, verb,\nadjective, or adverb, then this terminal may have the status\nof a phonological word on its own. Otherwise the word\ncombines with one or more orthographically distinct words\nto form a single phonological word that has no internal\nword or phrase boundaries. This is accomplished by adjoin-\ning a word to its left or right neighbor depending on its\nlexical category and its position in the tree. Function words,\ne.g. auxiliary verbs, articles, prepositions, pronouns, and\nconjunctions, are all eligible for adjunction in certain syn-\ntactic contexts. Content words, copular verbs, demonstra-\ntives, quantifiers and elements in the complementizer node\ncan serve as hosts for the adjoined material or stand alone.\nFigure 1 illustrates the effects of phonological word\nformation; the &quot;+&quot; indicates that adjunction has taken\nplace.\nArticle adjunction, for example, attaches a, an, and the\nto a following word, so that a sudden and the trees in Figure\n1 each becomes a single phonological word in which the\narticle acts as an unstressed syllable.

Second, we wished\nto investigate how well our approach would work for deter-\nmining prosodic phrasing in a text-to-speech synthesizer.\nExisting text-to-speech systems perform well on word pro-\nnunciation and short sentences, 12but when it comes to long\nsentences and paragraphs, ynthetic speech tends to be\ndifficult to listen to and understand. Many investigators\n(e.g. Allen 1976; Elowitz et al 1976; Luce et al 1983;\nCahn 1988) have suggested that the poor prosody of syn-\nthetic speech, in comparison with natural speech, is the\nprimary factor leading to difficulties in the comprehension\nof fluent synthetic speech. And while researchers in text-to-\nspeech synthesis have adopted a variety of approaches to\nprosodic phrase generation--from the simple punctuation-\nbased rules and function word listings of existing commer-\ncial systems to the sophisticated prosodic heuristics de-\nscribed in Emorine and Martin (1988) and O'Shaughnessy\n(1989)---the generation ofappropriate prosodic phrasing in\nunres~tricted xt has remained a problem.\nAs we will show, our results so far indicate that our\nexperimental system, which assigns a discourse neutral\nprosoclic phrasing on the level of sentences, provides a\nsignificant improvement i the quality of synthesized speech.\nWe believe that one reason for the improvement has to do\nwith the increased pitch range that our system uses. Text-\nto-speech systems that lack sentence-level phrasing must\ntake a conservative approach to pitch settings in order to\navoid misleading and inappropriate pitch modulations. Cor-\nrect phrase identification makes it possible to adopt an\nexpanded pitch range that greatly enhances the naturalness\nof the final speech.

However, in work-\ning under the assumption that discourse plays a role,\nhowever limited, in prosodic phrase determination, the\ncomparison of synthetic to human phrasing becomes less\nmeaningful since factors unknown to our system influence\nthe placement of phrase boundaries.\nAt the level of system building, a prosodic phrasing\nsystem should aim to make a text-to-speech system easier\nto understand. In general, adding phrasing to a text-to-\nspeech system will enhance synthetic speech both by break-\ning a run-on delivery into more easily processed chunks of\nspeech and by allowing the pitch range to be increased,\nenhancing naturalness. The primary requirement for mak-\ning synthetic speech easier to understand, however, is that\nthe phrasing system should first do no harm, i.e., it should\navoid misleading phrasings and phrasings like 38 that are\ndifficult for a listener to process.\n38. ??This is 11 the cat that caught II the rat that stole \\[I the\ncheese.\nTo address the issue of avoiding undesirable phrasings, a\nsystem like ours must be run against a set of utterances of\ndisparate l ngths and syntactic types to see where it breaks.\nTo do this, we accumulated a set of syntactically varied test\nsentences, had them read by two speakers, marked the\nprosodic phrase boundaries as we had done with the Holmes\nand Everest data, and ran the sentences through our pro-\nsodic phrase system for comparison with the human speak-\ners' phrasing. Phrasing in the speech of the two human\nspeakers was almost identical; where the speakers failed to\nmatch, we depended on the speaker with the more detailed\nphrasing to obtain a single transcript for comparison. The\nsentences with the phrase markings produced by the system\n(S) and by the human speakers (H) are given in Appendix\nA. In addition, we used the sentences of Grosjean et al\n(1979) to test our system; these were the same sentences\nused by G&G. They were produced by six subjects peak-\ning each sentence at five different speaking rates. We chose\nthese data both because they form an established, though\nsmall, ,corpus and because their phrase markings, derived\nby oscillographic tracings of pause duration, provide a\ncheck: against he possibility of error in human judgments\nof pause location and salience. A comparison of these data\nwith the output of our system is given in Appendix B.\nIn comparing human and synthetic prosodic phrasing\nwith an eye on synthetic phrasings that are either mislead-\ning or unprocessable, errors in the assignment of primary\nphrase boundaries are the most egregious. In the data in\nAppendix A, the human speakers produced 31 intrasenten-\ntial primary phrase boundaries, of which our system\nmatched 16 with its equivalent of a primary phrase bound-\nary. 'Yhe other primary phrase boundaries in the human\nproductions were matched in 9 cases with a secondary\nphra,;e boundary, and in 5 cases with a tertiary boundary.\nThe system thus missed 1 primary boundary, the one after\nbooks in 17. In the absence of research on the relative\nsignificance of different boundary types, we are assuming\nthat, with respect to the comprehensability and acceptabil-\nity of ,synthetic speech, the difference between a primary\nand ,;econdary phrase boundary is minimal. On the other\nhand, the tertiary boundary produced by our system is\nalmost imperceptible and cannot be considered equivalent\nto the primary boundary. The system thus matched, either\nexactly or approximately, 80% of the primary boundaries.\nIn looking at the primary phrase boundaries that the\nsystem failed to duplicate, we want to be sure that we avoid\ndifficult phrasings like that of 38 rather than match any\nparticular phrasing exactly. In sentences 9, 12, 17, and 21,\nwhere our system produced a tertiary boundary at the\nlocation of the human speakers' primary phrase boundary,\ncomprehensibility has not been diminished. The listener is\nmisled only in sentence 17, where our system generated a\nboundary at a location different from that of the human\nspeakers. In the system's phrasing of 17, the boundary\nbefore books corresponds to an interpretation f the utter-\nance in which the books are written by her uncle, which,\nwhile it is a possible phrasing, presumes a specific discourse\nsetting.\nA comparison of the secondary phrase boundaries in\nAppendix A shows similar correspondences. The human\nspeakers produced 26 secondary phrase boundaries. The\n166 Computational Linguistics Volume 16, Number 3, September 1990\nJ. Bachenko and E. Fitzpatrick Discourse-Neutral Prosodic Phrasing in English\nsystem matched 11 exactly and 12 with a primary or\ntertiary boundary. It thus failed to match 3 secondary\nboundaries, in sentences 9, 18, and 20, but only in sentence\n18 is the absence of the boundary misleading.\nTo sum up, there are 2 boundaries out of the 57 produced\nby the human speakers whose absence in the system's\noutput is truly problematic. Evaluation of the prosodic\nphrase system, however, must also consider cases of overgen-\neration. It is significant here that in the 21 sentences of\nAppendix A, the system never generated a primary phrase\nboundary that did not correspond to a boundary in the\nhuman productions, although the system overgenerated\nsecondary phrase boundaries at 7 locations. (We ignore the\novergeneration f tertiary boundaries as perceptually insig-\nnificant.) Three of these secondary boundaries are problem-\natic. Those in sentences 17 and 18 were discussed above as\nresulting from the misplacement of a boundary. The other\nunwanted secondary boundary occurs after was in sentence\n10 and results in an utterance that, like 38, is difficult to\nprocess.\nA comparison of our system's output with G&G's produc-\ntions, given in Appendix B, shows similar results. Of the 14\nprimary phrase boundaries in G&G's sentences, the system\nmatched 12 exactly. There were 2 primary boundaries,\nhowever, that the system missed completely. Both of these\nerrors were due to the presence of a sentential subject. For\nsentence 6, no parse was produced, but otherwise the\ninability of our system to generate the correct result here\nstems from the fact that the system discards the syntactic\nsentence node in the derivation of the prosodic phrasing. 15\nWith respect o overgeneration f phrase boundaries, the\nsystem overgenerated seriously only once, in sentence 4,\nwhere the subject is sentential.\nWe find these results encouraging; with respect to match-\ning, there were only four significant problems in the two\ncorpora, and overgeneration f a primary boundary oc-\ncurred only once. The suitability of our system for speech\napplications will depend on future tests to determine whether\nlisteners prefer &quot;prosodized speech&quot; that is imperfect, i.e.,\nspeech that will have some phrasing errors, to the relatively\n&quot;flat&quot; speech of systems that lack our phrasing rules. The\nweak link in our current system is the parser: most prob-\nlems with phrasing arise from parsing errors; in particular,\nincorrect part of speech assignment, incorrect analysis of\npre-head modifiers, and failure to recognize idiomatic or\nsemi-idiomatic expressions.

The system generated phrase bound- aries using information derived from the syntactic struc- ture of a sentence. While we saw significant improvements in the resulting synthesized speech, we also observed prob- lems with the system. Often these stemmed from our assumptions that both clausal structure and predicate- argument relations were important in determining prosodic phrasing.

Crystal (1969) claims that prosodic phrase boundaries will co-occur with grammatical functions uch as subject, predicate, modifier, and adjunct.

The problem here is that the phrasing in observed data often ignores the argument status of constituents. In 17a-f, for example, the phrasing makes no distinction between arguments and adjuncts.

Rather, it is viewed as &quot; . . . a performance factor, related to the diffi- culty of producing right branching structures such as \\[ 12\\]&quot; (p. 372). Thus phrasing, in their approach, is only indi- rectly related to syntax, since readjustment is done by special rules outside the grammar proper.

Many investigators (e.g. Allen 1976; Elowitz et al 1976; Luce et al 1983; Cahn 1988) have suggested that the poor prosody of syn- thetic speech, in comparison with natural speech, is the primary factor leading to difficulties in the comprehension of fluent synthetic speech. And while researchers in text-to- speech synthesis have adopted a variety of approaches to prosodic phrase generation--from the simple punctuation- based rules and function word listings of existing commer- cial systems to the sophisticated prosodic heuristics de- scribed in Emorine and Martin (1988) and O'Shaughnessy (1989)---the generation ofappropriate prosodic phrasing in unres~tricted xt has remained a problem. As we will show, our results so far indicate that our experimental system, which assigns a discourse neutral prosoclic phrasing on the level of sentences, provides a significant improvement i the quality of synthesized speech.

For example, although prosodic boundaries between sub- ject and verb do occur, there also exist prosodic patterns in which the boundary comes between the verb and object, i.e., the data reveal both X(VY) and (XV)Y groupings.

The boundaries that separate phonological phrases are the candidates for prosodic phrase boundaries, ince the prosodic phrases of speech consist of one or more phonological phrases. Our rules for phonological word formation are adopted, for the most part, from G&G, Grosjean and Gee (1987), and the account of monosyllabic destressing in Selkirk (1984). Thus in our analysis, rules of phonological word formation apply to the non-null terminal nodes in a syntax tree. If the terminal is a content word, i.e. noun, verb, adjective, or adverb, then this terminal may have the status of a phonological word on its own. Otherwise the word combines with one or more orthographically distinct words to form a single phonological word that has no internal word or phrase boundaries.

Our current analysis rests on two ideas. First, it is possible to describe a level of prosodic phrasing that is independent ofdiscourse semantics. Second, this discourse- neutral phrasing depends on a mix of syntactic and nonsyn- tactic factors; chiefly, syntactic onstituency, left-to-right word order, and constituent length. There is no necessary fit between syntactic structure and phrasing, since prosodic phrasing may ignore major syntactic boundaries in order to satisfy the constraints on phrase length. Our approach thus follows that of Grosjean et al (1979), namely, that phras- ing reflects &quot; . . . two (sometimes conflicting) demands on the speaker: the need to respect he linguistic structure of the sentence and the need to balance the length of the constituents in the output&quot; (p. 75). Section 2 will outline our analysis, focusing on the rela- tionship between syntactic and prosodic structure.

The system generated phrase bound- aries using information derived from the syntactic struc- ture of a sentence. While we saw significant improvements in the resulting synthesized speech, we also observed prob- lems with the system. Often these stemmed from our assumptions that both clausal structure and predicate- argument relations were important in determining prosodic phrasing.

In the following section, we discuss how the rules work in an experimental text-to-speech system. 3 AN EXPERIMENTAL TEXT-TO-SPEECH SYSTEM We have built an experimental text-to-speech system that uses our analysis of prosody to generate phrase boundaries for the Olive-Liberman synthesizer (Olive and Liberman 1985). Two concerns motivated our implementation. First, we hoped the system would provide us with a research tool for testing our ideas about syntax and phrasing against a large unrestricted collection of sentences. Second, we wished to investigate how well our approach would work for deter- mining prosodic phrasing in a text-to-speech synthesizer.

As we will show, our results so far indicate that our experimental system, which assigns a discourse neutral prosoclic phrasing on the level of sentences, provides a significant improvement i the quality of synthesized speech. We believe that one reason for the improvement has to do with the increased pitch range that our system uses.

Both predicate- argument relations and discourse factors have been exam- ined for their possible input to prosodic phrasing. Crystal (1969) claims that prosodic phrase boundaries will co-occur with grammatical functions uch as subject, predicate, modifier, and adjunct. Selkirk (1984) and Ne- spor and Vogel (1986) take a similar approach, but within a different heoretical framework. Previous versions of our work, as described in Bachenko et al (1986) also assume that phrasing is dependent on predicate-argument struc- ture. The problem here is that the phrasing in observed data often ignores the argument status of constituents. In 17a-f, for example, the phrasing makes no distinction between arguments and adjuncts. All of the sentences have the same X(VY) pattern even though Y is a complement in the first case (thefirst serious attempt) and an adjunct in the others.

Discrepancies in length throw constituents off balance, and so prosodic phrasing will cross constituent boundaries in order to give the phrases similar lengths; this is the case in Chickens were eating I\\[ the remaining green vegetables, where the subject-predicate boundary finds no prosodic correspondent. 4 The most explicit version of this approach is the analysis presented in Gee and Grosjean (1983) (henceforth G&G). Drawing on the psycholinguistic studies mentioned above and on aspects of the grammar of prosody outlined in Selkirk (1984), G&G propose an algorithm for mapping syntactic structure onto a hierarchical representation of phrasing; the rules they present accomplish this by integrat- ing syntactic information (e.g. constituent s ructure, left-to- right o:rdering) with information about constituent length. We have found that their rules, which are described in detail, provide a productive model for investigations of phrasing, and in what follows we shall frequently refer to their analysis. But, as we will show, G&G fall short of providing a comprehensive theory.

Both the output of the system and our prelimi- nary findings, which show that discourse factors influence just a small part of the phrasings that follow a verb, indicate that this approach is feasible. The analysis that we arrived at takes G&G and, to some extent, Selkirk (1984) as its starting point. Hence we are assuming that there is no necessary match between syntac- tic structure and prosodic phrasing. Prosody rules refer to syntactic structure, but they are not obliged to preserve it; independent principles of prosodic well-formedness, in par- ticular length calculations, may create entirely different structures that appear at odds with the syntax.

The boundaries that separate phonological phrases are the candidates for prosodic phrase boundaries, ince the prosodic phrases of speech consist of one or more phonological phrases. Our rules for phonological word formation are adopted, for the most part, from G&G, Grosjean and Gee (1987), and the account of monosyllabic destressing in Selkirk (1984). Thus in our analysis, rules of phonological word formation apply to the non-null terminal nodes in a syntax tree. If the terminal is a content word, i.e. noun, verb, adjective, or adverb, then this terminal may have the status of a phonological word on its own. Otherwise the word combines with one or more orthographically distinct words to form a single phonological word that has no internal word or phrase boundaries. This is accomplished by adjoin- ing a word to its left or right neighbor depending on its lexical category and its position in the tree.

Following Selkirk (1984), we have limited the eligible head categories to noun, verb, adjective, and adverb (although adjectives and adverbs do not count if they directly precede and modify another head). Examples 21 a-b illustrate the results of phonological phrase formation. In each case, the phonological phrase is created by a left-to- right process that collects material up to and including the head of a syntactic onstituent. Every phonological phrase boundary thus marks a syntactic head as well as the site of a possible prosodic boundary in speech.

There is no necessary fit between syntactic structure and phrasing, since prosodic phrasing may ignore major syntactic boundaries in order to satisfy the constraints on phrase length. Our approach thus follows that of Grosjean et al (1979), namely, that phras- ing reflects &quot; . . . two (sometimes conflicting) demands on the speaker: the need to respect he linguistic structure of the sentence and the need to balance the length of the constituents in the output&quot; (p. 75).

The problem here is that the phrasing in observed data often ignores the argument status of constituents. In 17a-f, for example, the phrasing makes no distinction between arguments and adjuncts.

Discrepancies in length throw constituents off balance, and so prosodic phrasing will cross constituent boundaries in order to give the phrases similar lengths; this is the case in Chickens were eating I\\[ the remaining green vegetables, where the subject-predicate boundary finds no prosodic correspondent. 4 The most explicit version of this approach is the analysis presented in Gee and Grosjean (1983) (henceforth G&G). Drawing on the psycholinguistic studies mentioned above and on aspects of the grammar of prosody outlined in Selkirk (1984), G&G propose an algorithm for mapping syntactic structure onto a hierarchical representation of phrasing; the rules they present accomplish this by integrat- ing syntactic information (e.g. constituent s ructure, left-to- right o:rdering) with information about constituent length. We have found that their rules, which are described in detail, provide a productive model for investigations of phrasing, and in what follows we shall frequently refer to their analysis. But, as we will show, G&G fall short of providing a comprehensive theory.

Both the output of the system and our prelimi- nary findings, which show that discourse factors influence just a small part of the phrasings that follow a verb, indicate that this approach is feasible. The analysis that we arrived at takes G&G and, to some extent, Selkirk (1984) as its starting point. Hence we are assuming that there is no necessary match between syntac- tic structure and prosodic phrasing. Prosody rules refer to syntactic structure, but they are not obliged to preserve it; independent principles of prosodic well-formedness, in par- ticular length calculations, may create entirely different structures that appear at odds with the syntax.

The boundaries that separate phonological phrases are the candidates for prosodic phrase boundaries, ince the prosodic phrases of speech consist of one or more phonological phrases. Our rules for phonological word formation are adopted, for the most part, from G&G, Grosjean and Gee (1987), and the account of monosyllabic destressing in Selkirk (1984). Thus in our analysis, rules of phonological word formation apply to the non-null terminal nodes in a syntax tree. If the terminal is a content word, i.e. noun, verb, adjective, or adverb, then this terminal may have the status of a phonological word on its own. Otherwise the word combines with one or more orthographically distinct words to form a single phonological word that has no internal word or phrase boundaries. This is accomplished by adjoin- ing a word to its left or right neighbor depending on its lexical category and its position in the tree.

Following Selkirk (1984), we have limited the eligible head categories to noun, verb, adjective, and adverb (although adjectives and adverbs do not count if they directly precede and modify another head). Examples 21 a-b illustrate the results of phonological phrase formation. In each case, the phonological phrase is created by a left-to- right process that collects material up to and including the head of a syntactic onstituent. Every phonological phrase boundary thus marks a syntactic head as well as the site of a possible prosodic boundary in speech.
