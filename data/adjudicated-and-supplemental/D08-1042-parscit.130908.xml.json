(2006) presented a hybrid tree kernel which combines a constituent and a path kernel. We however note that the paths in this kernel link predicates and their arguments and are very different from general paths in a tree that our dependency-based word subsequence kernel uses. Shen et al. (2003) proposed a lexicalized syntactic tree kernel which utilizes LTAG-based features. Toutanova et al. (2004) compute similarity between two HPSG parse trees by finding similarity between the leaf projection paths using string kernels. A few kernels based on dependency trees have also been proposed. Zelenko et al. (2003) proposed a tree kernel over shallow parse tree representations of sentences. This tree kernel was slightly generalized by Culotta and Sorensen (2004) to compute similarity between two dependency trees. In addition to the words, this kernel also incorporates word classes into the kernel. The kernel is based on counting matching subsequences of children of matching nodes. But as was also noted in (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005a), this kernel is opaque i.e. it is not obvious what the implicit features are and the authors do not describe it either. In contrast, our dependency-based word subsequence ke","@endWordPosition":"3927","@position":"22265","annotationId":"T1","@startWordPosition":"3924","@citStr":"Zelenko et al.

It may be noted that syntactic tree kernel is mostly doing worse than the word subsequence kernel. We believe this is because of the shortcomings of the syntactic tree kernel pointed out in Subsection 2.2. Since this is a semantic processing task, the words play an important role and the generalized syntactic categories are not very helpful. 6 Future Work In future, the dependency-based word subsequence kernel could be extended to incorporate word classes 407 like the kernels presented in (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005a; Zelenko et al., 2003). It should be possible to achieve this by incorporating matches between word classes in addition to the exact word matches in the kernel computations similar to the way in which the word subsequence kernel was extended to incorporate word classes in (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005b). This will generalize the kernel and make it more robust to data sparsity. The dependency-based word subsequence kernel could be tested on other tasks which require computing similarity between sentences or texts, like text classification, paraphrasing, summarization etc. We believe this kernel will help improve perform","@endWordPosition":"5177","@position":"30040","annotationId":"T2","@startWordPosition":"5174","@citStr":"Zelenko et al., 2003"}]},"title":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"Kernel methods for relation extraction."},"@valid":"true","authors":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"\n","author":[{"#tail":"\n","#text":"D Zelenko"},{"#tail":"\n","#text":"C Aone"},{"#tail":"\n","#text":"A Richardella"}]}}}}}}
