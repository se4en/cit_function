nowledge base. Further details about the APE planner can be found in (Freedman, 2000). 5 Implementation of Atlas-Andes 5.1 Architecture of Atlas-Andes The first system we have implemented with APE is a prototype Atlas-Andes system that replaces the hints usually given for an incorrect acceleration vector by a choice of generated subdialogues. Figure 4 shows the architecture of Atlas-Andes; any other system built with APE would look similar. Robust natural language understanding in Atlas-Andes is provided by Rosé's CARMEL system (Rosé 2000); it uses the spelling correction algorithm devised by Elmi and Evens (1998). 5.2 Structure of human tutorial dialogues In an earlier analysis (Kim, Freedman and Evens 1998) we showed that a significant portion of human-human tutorial dialogues can be modeled with the hierarchical structure of task-oriented dialogues (Grosz and Sidner 1986). Furthermore, a main building block of the discourse hierarchy, corresponding to the transaction level in Conversation Analysis (Sinclair and Coulthard 1975), matches the tutoring episode defined by VanLehn et al. (1998). A tutoring episode consists of the turns necessary to help the student make one correct entry on the interface.
