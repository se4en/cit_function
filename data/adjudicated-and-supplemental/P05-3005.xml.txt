rs using online resources. The system can run periodically to always keep up-to-date with these online resources. Using online resources that were available on Dec. 25, 2004, we obtained 4,046,733 terms for 1,640,082 entities. The dictionary can be accessed from the following website: http://biocreative.ifsm.umbc.edu/biothesauru s/. Contact: hfliu@umbc.edu 1 Introduction With the use of computers in storing the explosive amount of biological information, natural language processing (NLP) approaches have been explored to make the task of managing information recorded in free text more feasible [1, 2]. One requirement for NLP is the ability to accurately recognize terms that represent biological entities in free text. Another requirement is the ability to associate these terms with corresponding biological entities (i.e., records in biological databases) in order to be used by other automated systems for literature mining. Such task is called biological entity tagging. Biological entity tagging is not a trivial task because of several characteristics associated with biological entity names, namely: synonymy (i.e., different terms refer to the same entity), ambiguity (i.e., one term is asso
atabases) in order to be used by other automated systems for literature mining. Such task is called biological entity tagging. Biological entity tagging is not a trivial task because of several characteristics associated with biological entity names, namely: synonymy (i.e., different terms refer to the same entity), ambiguity (i.e., one term is associated with different entities), and coverage (i.e., entity terms or entities are not present in databases or knowledge bases). Methods for biological entity tagging can be categorized into two types: one is to use a dictionary and a mapping method [3, 4, 5], and the other is to markup terms in the text according to contextual cues, specific verbs, or machine learning [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. The performance of biological entity tagging systems using dictionaries depends on the coverage of the dictionary as well as mapping methods that can handle synonymous or ambiguous terms. Strictly speaking, tagging systems that do not use dictionaries are not biological entity tagging but biological term tagging, since tagged terms in text are not associated with specific biological entities stored in databases. It requires an additional step to map terms mentioned

d on high ambiguous terms to flag nonsensical terms (e.g., Novel protein) and are also curated based on the semantic categories acquired from the UMLS to flag descriptive terms that associate with other semantic types other than gene or proteins (e.g., terms that refer to species, cells or other small molecules). In the following, we first provide background and related work on dictionary construction using online resources. We then present our method on constructing the dictionary. 2 Resources The system utilizes several large size biological databases including three NCBI databases (GenPept [11], RefSeq [12], and Entrez GENE [13]), PSD database from Protein Information Resources (PIR) [14], and 17 UniProt [15]. Additionally, several model organism databases or nomenclature databases were used. Correspondences among records from these databases are identified using the rich cross-reference information provided by the iProClass database of PIR [14]. The following provides a brief description of each of the database. PIR Resources ? There are three databases in PIR: the Protein Sequence Database (PSD), iProClass, and PIR-NREF. PSD database includes functionally annotated protein sequenc

ion extracted from literature and curator-evaluated computational analysis. TrEMBL consists of computationally analyzed records that await full manual annotation. The UniProt Non-redundant Reference (UniRef) databases combine closely related sequences into a single record where similar sequences are grouped together. Three UniRef tables UniRef100, UniRef90 and UniRef50) are available for download: UniRef100 combines identical sequences and sub-fragments into a single UniRef entry; and UniRef90 and UniRef50 are built by clustering UniRef100 sequences into clusters based on the CD-HIT algorithm [16] such that each cluster is composed of sequences that have at least 90% or 50% sequence similarity, respectively, to the representative sequence. NCBI resources ? three data sources from NCBI were used in this study: GenPept, RefSeq, and Entrez GENE. GenPept entries are those translated from the GenBanknucleotide sequence database. RefSeq is a comprehensive, integrated, non-redundant set of sequences, including genomic DNA, transcript (RNA), and protein products, for major research organisms. Entrez GENE provides a unified query environment for genes defined by sequence and/or in NCBI's Map Vi
ez GENE. GenPept entries are those translated from the GenBanknucleotide sequence database. RefSeq is a comprehensive, integrated, non-redundant set of sequences, including genomic DNA, transcript (RNA), and protein products, for major research organisms. Entrez GENE provides a unified query environment for genes defined by sequence and/or in NCBI's Map Viewer. It records gene names, symbols, and many other attributes associated with genes and the products they encode. The UMLS ? the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) has been developed and maintained by National Library of Medicine (NLM) [17]. It contains three knowledge sources: the Metathesaurus (META), the SPECIALIST lexicon, and the Semantic Network. The META provides a uniform, integrated platform for over 60 biomedical vocabularies and classifications, and group different names for the same concept. The SPECIALIST lexicon contains syntactic information for many terms, component words, and English words, including verbs, which do not appear in the META. The Semantic Network contains information about the types or categories (e.g., ?Disease or Syndrome?, ?Virus?) to which all META concepts have been assigned. Other molecular b
