d with menus and mouse actions in graphical user interfaces (GUIs). It is completely programmable — developers can provide a speech interface to whatever functionality they desire. JAVOX has been successfully demonstrated with several GUI-based applications. Previous systems to assist in the development of spoken-language systems (SLSs) have focused on building stand-alone, customized applications, such as (Sutton et al., 1996) and (Pargellis et al., 1999). The goal of the JAVOX toolkit is to speech-enable traditional desktop applications — this is similar to the goals of the MELISSA project (Schmidt et al., 1998). It is intended to both speed the development of SLSs and to localize the speech-specific code within the application. JAVOX allows developers to add speech interfaces to applications at the end of the development process; SLSs no longer need to be built from the ground up. We will briefly present an overview of how JAVOX works, including its major modules. First, we 'Java and Java Speech are registered trademarks of Sun Microsystems, Inc. will examine TRANSLATOR, the implemented JAVOX natural language processing (NLP) component; its role is to translate from natural language utterances to th
