We do not use any other lexical 0-features that reference x, for fear that they would enable the learner to explain the rationales without changing 0 as desired (see the end of section 5.3). 14We parse each sentence with the Collins parser (Collins, 1999). Then the document has one big parse tree, whose root is DOC, with each sentence being a child of DOC. 15One might expect this function to be convex because pe and po are both log-linear models with no hidden variables.
