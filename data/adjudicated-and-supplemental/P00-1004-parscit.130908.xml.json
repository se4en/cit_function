In the simplest form, translations are stored and reused for the translation of new input. This approach, known as translation memory, example-based or case-based translation, can work on the word level as well as on structured examples as they are generated during analysis and generation in more grammar-based translation paradigms (Kitano, 1993; Brown, 1996). Finite state transducers, which can be learned from bilingual corpora, have been proposed for automatic translation (Amengual et al., 2000), as have been bilingual stochastic grammars (Wu, 1996). Statistical approaches (Wang and Waibel, 1997; Och et al., 1999) also fall into the category of corpus based approaches. In this paper, a translation method is proposed which is based on the very same principles as the aforementioned approaches.
