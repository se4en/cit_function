This idea was proposed by Krauwer and des Tombe (1981), Langendoen and Langsam (1987), and Pulman (1986), and was rediscovered by Black (1989) and recently by Johnson (1998). Since the latest publication in this area is more explicit in its presentation, we will base our treatment on this, instead of going to the historical roots of the method. One first constructs a modified left-corner recognizer from the grammar, in the form of a pushdown automaton. The stack height is bounded by a low number; Johnson (1998) claims a suitable number would be 5. The motivation for using the left-corner strategy is that the height of the stack maintained by a left-corner parser is already bounded by a constant in the absence of self-embedding.
