The model\u2019s errors are often reasonable misgeneralizations (e.g., assume regular conjugation where irregular would have been correct), and it is able to use even a small number of latent variables (including the latent alignment) to capture useful linguistic properties. In future work, we would like to identify a set of features, latent variables, and training methods that port well across languages and string-transduction tasks. We would like to use features that look at wide context on the input side, which is inexpensive (Jiampojamarn et al., 2007).
