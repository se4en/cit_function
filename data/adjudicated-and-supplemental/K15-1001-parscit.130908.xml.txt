(2004)) is from the average regret that we actually observe in a specific instantiation of the algorithm. Generalization for Online-to-Batch Conversion. In practice, perceptron-type algorithms are often applied in a batch learning scenario, i.e., the algorithm is applied for K epochs to a training sample of size T and then used for prediction on an unseen test set (Freund and Schapire, 1999; Collins, 2002). The difference to the online learning scenario is that we treat the multi-epoch algorithm as an empirical risk minimizer that selects a final weight vector wT,K whose expected loss on unseen data we would like to bound. We assume that the algorithm is fed with a sequence of examples x1, ... , xT, and at each epoch k = 1, ... , K it makes a prediction yt,k. The correct label is y∗t . For k = 1, ... , K and t = 1, ... , T, let `t,k = U(xt, y∗t ) − U(xt, yt,k), and denote by Δt,k and ξt,k the distance at epoch k for example t, and the slack at epoch k for example t, respectively. Finally, we de

The result follows directly from McDiarmid’s concentration inequality. 4 Experiments We used the LIG corpus3 which consists of 10,881 tuples of French-English post-edits (Potet et al., 2012). The corpus is a subset of the newscommentary dataset provided at WMT4 and contains input French sentences, MT outputs, postedited outputs and English references. To prepare SMT outputs for post-editing, the creators of the corpus used their own WMT10 system (Potet et al., 2010), based on the Moses phrase-based decoder (Koehn et al., 2007) with dense features. We replicated a similar Moses system using the same monolingual and parallel data: a 5-gram language model was estimated with the KenLM toolkit (Heafield, 2011) on news.en data (48.65M sentences, 1.13B tokens), pre-processed with the tools from the cdec toolkit (Dyer et al., 2010). perceptron cycling theorem (Block and Levin, 1970; Gelfand et al., 2010) should suffice to show a similar bound. 3http://www-clips.imag.fr/geod/User/marion.potet/ index.php?page=download 4http://statmt.org/wmt10/translation-task.html 5 regret 0.90 0.80 0.70 0.60 0.50 0.40 0.30 0.20 0.10 0.00 α 
formative feedback corresponds to improvements under standard evaluation metrics such as lowercased and tokenized TER, and that learning from weak and strong feedback leads to convergence in TER on test data. For this experiment, the post-edit data from the LIG corpus were randomly split into 3 subsets: PE-train (6,881 sentences), PE-dev, and PE-test (2,000 sentences each). PE-train was used for our online learning experiments. PE-test was held out for testing the algorithms’ progress on unseen data. PE-dev was used to obtain w* to define the utility model. This was done by MERT optimization (Och, 2003) towards post-edits under the TER target metric.

Rather, we want to show that learning from weak feedback leads to convergence in regret with respect to the optimal model, albeit at a slower rate than learning from strong feedback. The feedback data in this experiment were generated by searching the n-best list for translations that are α-in
