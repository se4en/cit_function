Our goal in this paper is to examine post- and sentence-level reason classification (RC) in ideological debates. Many online debaters use emotional languages, which may involve sarcasm and insults, to express their points, thereby making RC and SC in ideological debates potentially more challenging than that in other debate settings such as congressional debates and company-internal discussions (Walker et al., 2012). Besides examining the new task of RC in ideological debates, we believe that our work makes three contributions.
