We propose a two-tiered approach to achieve this goal and report on several initial studies to assess its potential. 1 Introduction An increasing portion of information and opinion exchange occurs in online interactions such as discussion forums, blogs, and webpage comments. This type of user-generated conversational data provides a wealth of naturally occurring arguments. Argument mining of online interactions, however, is still in its infancy (Abbott et al., 2011; Biran and Rambow, 2011; Yin et al., 2012; Andreas et al., 2012; Misra and Walker, 2013). One reason is the lack of annotated corpora in this genre. To make progress, we need to develop a principled and scalable way of determining which portions of texts are argumentative and what is the nature of argumentation. We propose a multi-step coding approach grounded in findings from argumentation research on managing the difficulties of coding arguments (Meyers and Brashers, 2010). In the first step, trained expert annotators identify basic argumentative features (coarse-grained analysis) in full-length threads. In the second step, we explore the feasibility of using crowdsourcing and ","@endWordPosition":"176","@position":"1243","annotationId":"T3","@startWordPosition":"173","@citStr":"Misra and Walker, 2013"},{"#tail":"\n","#text":" and then select the first 180 words in each of the two categories to represent our new vocabulary set of 360 words.
