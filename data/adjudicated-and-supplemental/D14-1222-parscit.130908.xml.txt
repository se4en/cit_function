(6) Over the first few weeks, Mancuso FBI has sprung straight from the headlines. The opening show featured a secretary of defense designate accused of womanizing (a la John Tower). . . . Most of all though, the show is redeemed by the character of Mancuso. Our previous work on bridging resolution on this corpus only focuses on its subtasks. In Hou et al. (2013a) we model bridging anaphora recognition as a subtask of learning fine-grained information status. We report an F-measure of 0.42 for bridging anaphora recognition. In Hou et al. (2013b) we propose a joint inference framework for antecedent selection by exploring Markov logic networks. We report an accuracy of 0.41 for antecedent selection given gold bridging anaphora. In this paper, we aim to solve these two substasks together, i.e., recognizing bridging anaphora and finding links to antecedents. 3 Method In this section, we describe our rule-based system for unrestricted bridging resolution
5; 1998) interprets bridging anaphora as a particular kind of functional concept, which in a given situation assign a necessarily unique correlate to a (implicit) possessor argument. He distinguishes between relational nouns (e.g. parts terms, kinship terms, role terms) and sortal nouns and points out that relational nouns are more frequently used as bridging anaphora than sortal nouns. Rule1 to Rule4 in our system aim to resolve such relational nouns. We design Rule5 and Rule6 to capture set bridging. Finally, Rule7 and Rule8 are motivated by previous work on implicit semantic role labeling (Laparra and Rigau, 2013) which focuses on few predicates. For all NPs in a document, each rule r is applied separately to predict a set of potential bridging links. Every rule has its own constraints on bridging anaphora and antecedents respectively. Bridging anaphors are diverse with regard to syntactic form and function: they can be modified by definite or indefinite determiners (Table 1), furthermore they can take the subject (e.g. Example 3 and Example 6) or other positions (e.g. Example 2 and Example 4) in sentences. The only frequent syntactic property shared is that bridging anaphors most often have a simple i
s on bridging anaphora. Finally, for each potential bridging anaphor ana ∈ 3A small list of 10 markers such as such, another ... and the presence of adjectives or adverbs in the comparative form are used to predict comparative NPs. 2084 Ar, a single best antecedent ante from a list of candidate NPs (Cana) is chosen if the rule’s constraint on antecedents is applied successfully. Every rule has its own scope to form the antecedent candidate set Cana. Instead of using a static sentence window to construct the list of antecedent candidates like most previous work for resolving bridging anaphora (Poesio et al., 1997; Markert et al., 2003; Poesio et al., 2004; Lassalle and Denis, 2011), we use the development set to estimate the proper scope for each rule. The scope is influenced by the following factors: (1) the nature of the target bridging link (e.g., set bridging is a local coherence phenomenon where the antecedent often occurs in the same or up to two sentences prior to the anaphor); and (2) the strength of the rule’s constraint to select the correct antecedent (e.g., in Rule8, the ability to select the correct antecedent decreases with increasing the scope to contain more antecedent candidates). In

In the following, we describe the motivation f
aphor ana among all NPs preceding ana from the same sentence as well as from the previous two sentences is predicted to be the antecedent. The semantic connectivity of an NP to a potential anaphor is measured via the hit counts of the preposition pattern query (anaphor preposition NP) in big corpora4. An initial effort to extract partOf relations using WordNet yields low recall on the development set. Therefore we use semantic connectivity expressed by prepositional patterns (e.g. the basement of the house) to capture underlying semantic relations. Such syntactic patterns are also explored in Poesio et al. (2004) to resolve meronymy bridging. 4We use Gigaword (Parker et al., 2011) with automatic POS tag and NP chunk information. Rule2: relative person NPs. This rule is used to capture the bridging relation between a relative (e.g. The husband) and its antecedent (e.g. She). A list of 110 such relative nouns is extracted from WordNet. However, some relative nouns are frequently used generically instead of being bridging, such as children. To exclude such cases, we compute the argument taking ratio α for an NP using NomBank (Meyers et al., 2004). For each NP, α is calculated via its head frequency in th
 be the closest NP among all plural, subject NPs preceding the potential anaphor from the same sentence as well as from the previous two sentences (e.g. Reds and yellows in Example 8). If such an NP does not exist, the closest NP among all plural, object NPs preceding the potential anaphor from the same sentence as well as from the previous two sentences is chosen to be the predicted antecedent (e.g. several problems in Example 3). (8) Reds and yellows went about their business with a kind of measured grimness. Some frantically dumped belongings into pillowcases. Rule7: argument-taking NPs I. Laparra and Rigau (2013) found that different instances of the same predicate in a document likely maintain the same argument fillers. Here we follow this assumption but apply it to nouns and their nominal modifiers only: different instances of the same noun predicate likely maintain the same argument fillers indicated by nominal modifiers. First, a common noun phrase from A is added to Ar7 if: (1) its argument taking ratio α is bigger than 0.5; (2) it does not contain any nominal or adjective pre-modifications; and (3) it is not modified by indefinite determiners5 which usually introduce new discourse referents (Haw

(2013a) classify eight fine-grained information status (IS) categories for NPs: old, new and 6 mediated categories (syntactic, worldKnowledge, bridging, comparative, aggregate and function). Features from Markert et al. (2012) work well to identify old, new and several mediated categories but fail to recognize most bridging anaphora. Hou et al. (2013a) remedy this by adding discourse structure features (f1-f3), semantic features (f4- f10) and features to detect generic nouns (f11- 2089 Feature Value for anaphor candidate a whether a contains any nominal pre-modifications f1 preModByNominal whether a contains any adjective modifications f2 preModByAdj whether a is a job title about GPE (e.g. mayor or official) f3 isGPEJobTitle whether the argument taking ratio of a is bigger than 0.5 f4 isArgumentTakingNP for antece

Table 5 shows all features we use for selecting antecedents for bridging anaphora. “∗” indicates the resources that are used in the rule-based system. These features are from Hou et al. (2013b)’s local pairwise model. They try to model: (1) the semantic relations between bridging anaphors and their antecedents (f1 to f4); (2) the salience of an antecedent from different perspectives (f5 to f8); and (3) the syntactic and lexical constraints between anaphor and antecedent (f9 to f12). Apart from the features shown in Table 4 and Table 5, we further enrich mlSystem ruleFeats+atomFeats with additional atomic features used in the rule-based system (Table 6). mlSystem atomFeats Based on mlSystem ruleFeats+atomFeats, the rule features from the rule-based system are removed. 4.4 Baseline
