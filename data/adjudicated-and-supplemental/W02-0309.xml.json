In order to cope with such variation, morphological analysis is concerned with the reverse processing of inflection (e.g., ?search  ed?, ?search  ing?)1 , derivation (e.g., ?search  er? or ?search  able?) and composition (e.g., German ?Blut  hoch  druck? [?high blood pressure?]).

None of these differences are statistically significant when the two-tailed Wilcoxon test is applied at all eleven recall levels. Trigram indexing (TG) yields the poorest results of all methodologies being tested. It is comparable to WS at low recall levels ( BOCEGIH ), but at high ones its precision decreases almost dramatically. Unless very high rates of misspellings are to be expected (this explains the favorable results for trigram indexing in (Franz et al, 2000)) one cannot really recommend this method. The subword approach (SU) clearly outperforms the previously discussed approaches. We compare it here with WSAO, the best-performing lexicon-free method. Within this setting, the gain in precision for SU ranges from 6.5% to 14% ( BPCQEGIH ), while for high recall values ( BRJMLNGIH ) it is still in the range of 4.8% to 6%.

The key for quality improvement seems to be rooted mainly in the presence or absence of some form of dictionary. Empirical evidence has been brought forward that inflectional and/or derivational stemmers augmented by dictionaries indeed perform substantially better than those without access to such lexical repositories (Krovetz, 1993; Kraaij and Pohlmann, 1996; Tzoukermann et al, 1997).

It would be interesting to evaluate the retrieval effectiveness (in terms of precision and recall) of different versions of the synonym class indexing approach in those cases where retrieval using word or subword indexes fails due to a complete mismatch between query and documents. This will become even more interesting when mappings of our synonym identifiers to a large medical thesaurus (MeSH, (NLM, 2001)) are incorporated into our system. Alternatively, we may think of user-centered comparative studies (Hersh et al, 1995). 4.1 The AltaVistaTM Experiment Before we developed our own search engine, we used the AltaVistaTM Search Engine 3.0 (http:// solutions.altavista.com) as our testbed, a widely distributed, easy to install off-the-shelf IR system.

While this is simply irrelevant for general-purpose morphological analyzers, dealing with such phenomena is crucial for any attempt to cope adequately with medical free-texts in an IR setting (Wolff, 1984). We here propose an approach to document retrieval which is based on the idea of segmenting query and document terms into basic subword units. Hence, this approach combines procedures for deflection, dederivation and decomposition.

This will become even more interesting when mappings of our synonym identifiers to a large medical thesaurus (MeSH, (NLM, 2001)) are incorporated into our system.

Given such a time-consuming task, we investigated only a small number of user queries in our experiments. This also elucidates why we did not address interrater reliability. The queries and the relevance judgments were hidden from the developers of the subword dictionary. For unbiased evaluation of our approach, we used a home-grown search engine (implemented in the PYTHON script language). It crawls text/HTML files, produces an inverted file index, and assigns salience weights to terms and documents based on a simple tf-idf metric. The retrieval process relies on the vector space model (Salton, 1989), with the cosine measure expressing the similarity between a query and a document. The search engine produces a ranked output of documents. We also incorporate proximity data, since this information becomes particularly important in the segmentation of complex word forms. So a distinction must be made between a document containing ?append  ectomy? and ?thyroid  itis? and another one containing ?append  ic  itis? and ?thyroid  ectomy?. Our proximity criterion assigns a higher ranking to adjacent and a lower one to distant search terms.

The key for quality improvement seems to be rooted mainly in the presence or absence of some form of dictionary. Empirical evidence has been brought forward that inflectional and/or derivational stemmers augmented by dictionaries indeed perform substantially better than those without access to such lexical repositories (Krovetz, 1993; Kraaij and Pohlmann, 1996; Tzoukermann et al, 1997). This result is particularly valid for natural languages with a rich morphology ? both in terms of derivation and (single-word) composition. Document retrieval in these languages suffers from serious performance degradation with the stemmingonly query-term-to-text-word matching paradigm. We proposed here a dictionary-based approach in which morphologically complex word forms, no matter whether they appear in queries or in documents, are segmented into relevant subwords and these subwords are subsequently submitted to the matching procedure. This way, the impact of word form alterations can be","@endWordPosition":"4750","@position":"28846","annotationId":"T24","@startWordPosition":"4747","@citStr":"Tzoukermann et al, 1997"}},"title":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"Effective use of natural language processing techniques for automatic conflation of multi-word terms: The role of derivational morphology, part of speech tagging, and shallow parsing."},"booktitle":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"In Proc. of the 20th International ACM SIGIR Conference,"},"@valid":"true","authors":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"\n","author":[{"#tail":"\n","#text":"E Tzoukermann"},{"#tail":"\n","#text":"J Klavans"},{"#tail":"\n","#text":"C Jacquemin"}]}},{"volume":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"24"},"#tail":"\n","date":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"1985"},"rawString":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"F.

While this is simply irrelevant for general-purpose morphological analyzers, dealing with such phenomena is crucial for any attempt to cope adequately with medical free-texts in an IR setting (Wolff, 1984). We here propose an approach to document retrieval which is based on the idea of segmenting query and document terms into basic subword units. Hence, this approach combines procedures for deflection, dederivation and decomposition. Subwords cannot be equated with linguistically significant morphemes, in general, since their granularity may be coarser than that of morphemes (cf. our discussion in Section 2). We validate our claims in Section 4 on a substantial biomedical document collection (cf. Section 3). 2 Morphological Analysis for Medical IR Morphological analysis for IR has requirements ","@endWordPosition":"642","@position":"4256","annotationId":"T27","@startWordPosition":"641","@citStr":"Wolff, 1984"}]},"title":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"The use of morphosemantic regularities in the medical vocabulary for automatic lexical coding."},"@valid":"true","authors":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"\n","author":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"S Wolff"}}},{"#tail":"\n","date":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"2001"},"rawString":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"P.
