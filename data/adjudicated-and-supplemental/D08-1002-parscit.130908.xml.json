Additionally, AUCONTRAIRE uses edit-distance and tokenbased string similarity (Cohen et al., 2003) between apparently contradictory values of y to identify synonyms. Meronyms: For some relations, there is no contradiction when y1 and y2 share a meronym, i.e. \u201cpart of\u201d relation. For example, in the set born in(Mozart,\u2022) there is no contradiction between the y values \u201cSalzburg\u201d and \u201cAustria\u201d, but \u201cSalzburg\u201d conflicts with \u201cVienna\u201d. Although this is only true in cases where y occurs in an upward monotone context (MacCartney and Manning, 2007), in practice genuine contradictions between y-values sharing a meronym relationship are extremely rare. We therefore simply assigned contradictions between meronyms a probability close to zero. We used the Tipster Gazetteer4 and WordNet to identify meronyms, both of which have high precision but low coverage. Argument Typing: Two y values are not contradictory if they are of different argument types. For example, the relation born in can take a date or a location for the y value. While a person can be born in only one year and in only one city, a person can be born in both a year and a city.
