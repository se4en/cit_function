Words are known to be associated with\neach other in terms of, orthography, phonology,\nmorphology and semantics. However, the precise\nnature of these relations is unknown.\nAn important issue that has been a subject of\nstudy for a long time is to identify the fundamen-\ntal units in terms of which the mental lexicon is\norganized. That is, whether lexical representa-\ntions in the mental lexicon are word based or are\nthey organized along morphological lines. For\nexample, whether a word such as ?unimaginable?\nis stored in the mental lexicon as a whole word\nor do we break it up ?un-? , ?imagine? and ?-\nable?, understand the meaning of each of these\nconstituent and then recombine the units to com-\nprehend the whole word.\nSuch questions are typically answered by de-\nsigning appropriate priming experiments (Mars-\nlen-Wilson et al, 1994) or other lexical decision\ntasks. The reaction time of the subjects for re-\ncognizing various lexical items under appropriate\nconditions reveals important facts about their\norganization in the brain.

Moreover, Indian lan-\nguages show some distinct phenomena like,\ncompound and composite verbs for which no\nsuch investigations have been conducted yet. On\nthe other hand, experiments indicate that mental\nrepresentation and processing of morphologically\ncomplex words are not quite language indepen-\ndent (Taft, 2004). Therefore, the findings from\nexperiments in one language cannot be genera-\nlized to all languages making it important to\nconduct similar experimentations in other lan-\nguages.\nThis work aims to design cognitively moti-\nvated computational models that can explain the\norganization and processing of Bangla morpho-\nlogically complex words in the mental lexicon.\nPresently we will concentrate on the following\ntwo aspects:\n? Organization and processing of Bangla Poly-\nmorphemic words: our objective here is to de-\ntermine whether the mental lexicon decompos-\nes morphologically complex words into its\nconstituent morphemes or does it represent the\nunanalyzed surface form of a word.\n? Organization and processing of Bangla com-\npound verbs (CV): compound verbs are the\nsubject of much debate in linguistic theory. No\nconsensus has been reached yet with respect to\nthe issue that whether to consider them as uni-\ntary lexical units or are they syntactically as-\nsembled combinations of two independent lex-\nical units. As linguistic arguments have so far\nnot led to a consensus, we here use cognitive\nexperiments to probe the brain signatures of\nverb-verb combinations and propose cognitive\nas well as computational models regarding the\npossible organization and processing of Bangla\nCVs in the mental lexicon (ML).\nWith respect to this, we apply the different\npriming and other lexical decision experiments,\ndescribed in literature (Marslen-Wilson et al,\n1994; Bentin, S. and Feldman, 1990) specifically\nfor derivationally suffixed polymorphemic words\nand compound verbs of Bangla. Our cross-modal\nand masked priming experiment on Bangla deri-\nvationally suffixed words shows that morpholog-\nical relatedness between lexical items triggers a\nsignificant priming effect, even when the forms\nare phonologically/orthographically unrelated.\nThese observations are similar to those reported\nfor English and indicate that derivationally suf-\nfixed words in Bangla are in general accessed\nthrough decomposition of the word into its con-\nstituent morphemes. Further, based on the expe-\nrimental data we have developed a series of\ncomputational models that can be used to predict\nthe decomposition of Bangla polymorphemic\nwords. Our evaluation result shows that decom-\nposition of a polymorphemic word depends on\nseveral factors like, frequency, productivity of\nthe suffix and the compositionality between the\nstem and the suffix.\nThe organization of the paper is as follows:\nSec. 2 presents related works; Sec. 3 describes\nexperiment design and procedure; Sec. 4 presents\nthe processing of CVs; and finally, Sec. 5 con-\ncludes the paper by presenting the future direc-\ntion of the work.\n"},{"#tail":"\n","@confidence":"0.999836485714286","#text":"\nOver the last few decades many studies have at-\ntempted to understand the representation and\nprocessing of morphologically complex words in\nthe brain for various languages. Most of the stu-\ndies are designed to support one of the two mu-\ntually exclusive paradigms: the full-listing and\nthe morphemic model. The full-listing model\nclaims that polymorphic words are represented as\na whole in the human mental lexicon (Bradley,\n1980; Butterworth, 1983). On the other hand,\nmorphemic model argues that morphologically\ncomplex words are decomposed and represented\nin terms of the smaller morphemic units. The\naffixes are stripped away from the root form,\nwhich in turn are used to access the mental lex-\nicon (Taft and Forster, 1975; Taft, 1981; MacK-\nay, 1978). Intermediate to these two paradigms is\nthe partial decomposition model that argues that\ndifferent types of morphological forms are\nprocessed separately. For instance, the derived\nmorphological forms are believed to be\nrepresented as a whole, whereas the representa-\ntion of the inflected forms follows the morphem-\nic model (Caramazza et al, 1988).\nTraditionally, priming experiments have been\nused to study the effects of morphology in lan-\nguage processing. Priming is a process that re-\nsults in increase in speed or accuracy of response\nto a stimulus, called the target, based on the oc-\ncurrence of a prior exposure of another stimulus,\ncalled the prime (Tulving et al, 1982).

Later, Baayen(2000) proposed the\ndual processing race model that proposes that a\nspecific morphologically complex form is ac-\ncessed via its parts if the frequency of that word\nis above a certain threshold of frequency, then\nthe direct route will win, and the word will be\naccessed as a whole.

One notable means is to identify whether\nthe stem or suffix frequency is involved in the\nprocessing stage of that word. For this, we apply\ndifferent frequency based models to the Bangla\npolymorphemic words and try to evaluate their\nperformance by comparing their predicted results\nwith the result obtained through the priming ex-\nperiment.\nModel-1: Base and Surface word frequency ef-\nfect- It states that the probability of decomposi-\ntion of a Bangla polymorphemic word depends\nupon the frequency of its base word. Thus, if the\nstem frequency of a polymorphemic word\ncrosses a given threshold value, then the word\nwill decomposed into its constituent morpheme.\nSimilar claim has been made for surface word\nfrequency model where decomposition depends\nupon the frequency of the surface word itself.\nWe have evaluated both the models with the 500\nwords used in the priming experiments discussed\nabove. We have achieved an accuracy of 62%\nand 49% respectively for base and surface word\nfrequency models.\nModel-2: Combining the base and surface word\nfrequency- In a pursuit towards an extended\nmodel, we combine model 1 and 2 together. We\ntook the log frequencies of both the base and the\nderived words and plotted the best-fit regression\ncurve over the given dataset.\nThe evaluation of this model over the same set\nof 500 target words returns an accuracy of 68%\nwhich is better than the base and surface word\nfrequency models. However, the proposed model\nstill fails to predict processing of around 32% of\nwords. This led us to further enhance the model.\nFor this, we analyze the role of suffixes in mor-\nphological processing.\nModel-3: Degree of Affixation and Suffix Prod-\nuctivity: we examine whether the regression\nanalysis between base and derived frequency of\nBangla words varies between suffixes and how\nthese variations affect morphological decomposi-\ntion. With respect to this, we try to compute the\ndegree of affixation between the suffix and the\nbase word. For this, we perform regression anal-\nysis on sixteen different Bangla suffixes with\nvarying degree of type and token frequencies.\nFor each suffix, we choose 100 different derived\nwords. We observe that those suffixes having\nhigh value of intercept are forming derived\nwords whose base frequencies are substantially\nhigh as compared to their derived forms. Moreo-\nver we also observe that high intercept value for\na given suffix indicates higher inclination to-\nwards decomposition.\nNext, we try to analyze the role of suffix\ntype/token ratio and compare them with the\nbase/derived frequency ratio model. This has\nbeen done by regression analysis between the\nsuffix type-token ratios with the base-surface\nfrequency ratio.\nWe further tried to observe the role of suffix\nproductivity in morphological processing. For\nthis, we computed the three components of prod-\nuctivity P, P* and V as discussed in (Hay and\nPlag, 2004). P is the ?conditioned degree of\nproductivity? and is the probability that we are\nencountering a word with an affix and it is\nrepresenting a new type. P* is the ?hapaxed-\nconditioned degree of productivity?.

Finally, we computed the\nproductivity of a suffix through its P, P* and V\nvalues. We found that decomposition of Bangla\npolymorphemic word is directly proportional to\nthe productivity of the suffix. Therefore, words\nthat are composed of productive suffixes (P val-\nue ranges between 0.6 and 0.9) like ?-oYAlA?,\n?-giri?, ?-tba? and ?-panA? are highly decom-\nposable than low productive suffixes like ?-Ani?,\n?-lA?, ?-k?, and ?-tama?. The evaluation of the\nproposed model returns an accuracy of 76%\nwhich comes to be 8% better than the preceding\nmodels.\nCombining Model-2 and Model-3: One impor-\ntant observation that can be made from the above\nresults is that, model-3 performs best in deter-\nmining the true negative values. It also possesses\na high recall value of (85%) but having a low\nprecision of (50%). In other words, the model\ncan predict those words for which decomposition\nwill not take place. On the other hand, results of\nModel-2 posses a high precision of 70%. Thus,\nwe argue that combining the above two models\ncan better predict the decomposition of Bangla\npolymorphemic words. Hence, we combine the\ntwo models together and finally achieved an\noverall accuracy of 80% with a precision of 87%\nand a recall of 78%. This surpasses the perfor-\nmance of the other models discussed earlier.\nHowever, around 22% of the test words were\nwrongly classified which the model fails to justi-\nfy.

In the first technique, we annotated 4500\nV1+V2 sequences, along with their example sen-\ntences, using a group of three linguists (the ex-\npert subjects). We asked the experts to classify\nthe verb sequences into three classes namely,\nCV, not a CV and not sure. Each linguist has\nreceived 2000 verb pairs along with their respec-\ntive example sentences. Out of this, 1500 verb\nsequences are unique to each of them and rest\n500 are overlapping. We measure the inter anno-\ntator agreement using the Fleiss Kappa (Fleiss et\nal., 1981) measure (?) where the agreement lies\naround 0.79. Next, out of the 500 common verb\nsequences that were annotated by all the three\nlinguists, we randomly choose 300 V1+V2 pairs\nand presented them to 36 native Bangla speakers.\nWe ask each subjects to give a compositionality\nscore of each verb sequences under 1-10 point\nscale, 10 being highly compositional and 1 for\nnoncompositional. We found an agreement of\n?=0.69 among the subjects. We also observe a\ncontinuum of compositionality score among the\nverb sequences. This reflects that it is difficult to\nclassify Bangla verb sequences discretely into\nthe classes of CV and not a CV. We then, com-\npare the compositionality score with that of the\nexpert user?s annotation. We found a significant\ncorrelation between the expert annotation and the\ncompositionality score. We observe verb se-\nquences that are annotated as CVs (like, ????\n??? ,??? ?? ,??? ?? ) have got low compositio-\nnality score (average score ranges between 1-4)\non the other hand high compositional values are\nin general tagged as not a cv (???? ??? (come and\nget), ???? ?? (return back), ???? ?????? (kept),\n????? ??? (roll on floor)). This reflects that verb\nsequences which are not CV shows high degree\nof compositionality. In other words non CV\nverbs can directly interpret from their constituent\nverbs. This leads us to the possibility that com-\npositional verb sequences requires individual\nverbs to be recognized separately and thus the\ntime to recognize such expressions must be\ngreater than the non-compositional verbs which\nmaps to a single expression of meaning. In order\nto validate such claim we perform a lexical deci-\nsion experiment using 32 native Bangla speakers\nwith 92 different verb sequences. We followed\nthe same experimental procedure as discussed in\n(Taft, 2004) for English polymorphemic words.\nHowever, rather than derived words, the subjects\nwere shown a verb sequence and asked whether\nthey recognize them as a valid combination. The\nreaction time (RT) of each subject is recorded.\nOur preliminarily observation from the RT anal-\nysis shows that as per our claim, RT of verb se-\nquences having high compositionality value is\nsignificantly higher than the RTs for low or non-\ncompositional verbs. This proves our hypothesis\nthat Bangla compound verbs that show less com-\npositionality are stored as a hole in the mental\nlexicon and thus follows the full-listing model\nwhereas compositional verb phrases are indivi-\ndually parsed. However, we do believe that our\nexperiment is composed of a very small set of\ndata and it is premature to conclude anything\nconcrete based only on the current experimental\nresults.\n"},{"#tail":"\n","@confidence":"0.988917212121212","#text":"\nIn the next phase of our work we will focus on\nthe following aspects of Bangla morphologically\ncomplex words:\nThe Word Familiarity Effect: Here, our aim is to\nstudy the role of familiarity of a word during its\nprocessing.

Words are known to be associated with each other in terms of, orthography, phonology, morphology and semantics. However, the precise nature of these relations is unknown. An important issue that has been a subject of study for a long time is to identify the fundamental units in terms of which the mental lexicon is organized. That is, whether lexical representations in the mental lexicon are word based or are they organized along morphological lines. For example, whether a word such as ?unimaginable? is stored in the mental lexicon as a whole word or do we break it up ?un-? , ?imagine? and ?-","@endWordPosition":"223","@position":"1549","annotationId":"T1","@startWordPosition":"222","@citStr":"Aitchison, 1987"}},"title":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"Words in the mind: An introduction to the mental"},"@valid":"true","authors":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"\n","author":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"J Aitchison"}}},{"#tail":"\n","date":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"1997"},"rawString":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"Baayen R.H., T.

Most of the studies are designed to support one of the two mutually exclusive paradigms: the full-listing and the morphemic model. The full-listing model claims that polymorphic words are represented as a whole in the human mental lexicon (Bradley, 1980; Butterworth, 1983). On the other hand, morphemic model argues that morphologically complex words are decomposed and represented in terms of the smaller morphemic units. The affixes are stripped away from the root form, which in turn are used to access the mental lexicon (Taft and Forster, 1975; Taft, 1981; MacKay, 1978).

See Pulverm?ller (2002) for a detailed account of such phenomena. It has been argued that frequency of a word influences the speed of lexical processing and thus, can serve as a diagnostic tool to observe the nature and organization of lexical representations. (Taft, 1975) with his experiment on English inflected words, argued that lexical decision responses of polymorphemic words depends upon the base word frequency. Similar observation for surface word frequency was also observed by (Bertram et al, 2000;Bradley, 1980;Burani et al, 1987;Burani et al, 1984;Schreuder et al, 1997; Taft 1975;Taft, 2004) where it has been claimed that words having low surface frequency tends to decompose. Later, Baayen(2000) proposed the dual processing race model that proposes that a specific morphologically complex form is accessed via its parts if the frequency of that word is above a certain threshold of frequency, then the direct route will win, and the word will be accessed as a whole. If it is below that same threshold of frequency, the parsing route will win, and the word will be accessed via its parts. 2.2 Representati","@endWordPosition":"1405","@position":"9090","annotationId":"T4","@startWordPosition":"1404","@citStr":"Bradley, 1980"}]},"title":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"Lexical representation of derivational relation,"},"@valid":"true","authors":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"\n","author":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"D Bradley"}}},{"#tail":"\n","date":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"1993"},"editor":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"In M.

Such questions are typically answered by designing appropriate priming experiments (Marslen-Wilson et al, 1994) or other lexical decision tasks. The reaction time of the subjects for recognizing various lexical items under appropriate conditions reveals important facts about their organization in the brain.

Our cross-modal and masked priming experiment on Bangla derivationally suffixed words shows that morphological relatedness between lexical items triggers a significant priming effect, even when the forms are phonologically/orthographically unrelated.

Therefore, the cost of retrieving a word from the secondary memory is directly proportional to the cost of retrieving the individual parts (i.e the stem and the suffix). Thus, following the work of (Milin et al, 2009) we define the compositionality of a morphologically complex word (We) as: C(We)=?1H(We)+?2H(e)+?3H(W|e)+ ?4H(e|W) Where, H(x) is entropy of an expression x, H(W|e) is the conditional entropy between the stem W and suffix e and ? is the proportionality factor whose value is computed through regression analysis. Next, we tried to compute the compositionality of the stem and suffixes in terms of relative entropy D(W||e) and Point wise mutual information (PMI).

(Taft, 1975) with his experiment on English inflected words, argued that lexical decision responses of polymorphemic words depends upon the base word frequency. Similar observation for surface word frequency was also observed by (Bertram et al, 2000;Bradley, 1980;Burani et al, 1987;Burani et al, 1984;Schreuder et al, 1997; Taft 1975;Taft, 2004) where it has been claimed that words having low surface frequency tends to decompose. Later, Baayen(2000) proposed the dual processing race model that proposes that a specific morphologically complex form is accessed via its parts if the frequency of that word is above a certain threshold of frequency, then the direct route will win, and the word will be accessed as a whole. If it is below that same threshold of frequency, the parsing route will win, and the word will be accessed via its parts. 2.2 Representation of Compound Verbs A compound verb (CV) consists of a sequence of two verbs (V1 a","@endWordPosition":"1417","@position":"9173","annotationId":"T22","@startWordPosition":"1416","@citStr":"Taft, 2004"},{"#tail":"\n","#text":"hich are not CV shows high degree of compositionality. In other words non CV verbs can directly interpret from their constituent verbs. This leads us to the possibility that compositional verb sequences requires individual verbs to be recognized separately and thus the time to recognize such expressions must be greater than the non-compositional verbs which maps to a single expression of meaning. In order to validate such claim we perform a lexical decision experiment using 32 native Bangla speakers with 92 different verb sequences. We followed the same experimental procedure as discussed in (Taft, 2004) for English polymorphemic words. However, rather than derived words, the subjects were shown a verb sequence and asked whether they recognize them as a valid combination. The reaction time (RT) of each subject is recorded. Our preliminarily observation from the RT analysis shows that as per our claim, RT of verb sequences having high compositionality value is significantly higher than the RTs for low or noncompositional verbs. This proves our hypothesis that Bangla compound verbs that show less compositionality are stored as a hole in the mental lexicon and thus follows the full-listing model","@endWordPosition":"4015","@position":"24993","annotationId":"T23","@startWordPosition":"4014","@citStr":"Taft, 2004"}]},"title":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"Morphological decomposition and the reverse base frequency effect."},"@valid":"true","authors":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"\n","author":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"M Taft"}}}]}}]}}
