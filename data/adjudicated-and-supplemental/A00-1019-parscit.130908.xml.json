Our approach relies on distributional and frequency statistics computed on each sequence of words found in a training corpus. For sake of efficiency, we used the suffix array technique to get a compact representation of our training corpus. This method allows the efficient retrieval of arbitrary length n-grams (Nagao and Mori, 94; Haruno et al., 96; Ikehaxa et al., 96; Shimohata et al., 1997; Russell, 1998). The literature abounds in measures that can help to decide whether words that co-occur are linguistically significant or not. In this work, the strength of association of a sequence of words wr = w1, wn is computed by two measures: a likelihood-based one p(wr) (where is the likelihood ratio given in (Dunning, 93)) and an entropy-based one e(w) (Shimohata et al., 1997).
