Their underlying approaches can be\nclassified into four types: (1) Optical character\nrecognition (OCR) based (Chung 1993), (2) On-\nline handwriting based (Lee et al 1997), (3)\nSpeech based (Fu et al 1996, Chen et al 2000),\nand (4) Keyboard based consists of phonetic\nand pinyin based (Chang et al 1991, Hsu et al\n1993, Hsu 1994, Hsu et al 1999, Kuo 1995, Lua\nand Gan 1992); arbitrary codes based [Fan et al\n1988]; and structure scheme based (Huang\n1985).\nCurrently, the most popular method for Chi-\nnese input is phonetic and pinyin based, because\nChinese people are taught to write the corre-\nsponding phonetic and pinyin syllables of each\nChinese character and word in primary school.\nIn Chinese, each Chinese character corresponds\nto at least one syllable; and each Chinese word\ncan be a mono-syllabic word, such as ??\n(mouse)?, a bi-syllabic word, such as ???\n(kangaroo)?, or a multi-syllabic word, such as\n????(Mickey mouse).? Although there are\nmore than 13,000 distinct Chinese characters (of\nwhich 5,400 are commonly used), there are only\nabout 1,300 distinct syllables. As per (Qiao et al\n1984), each Chinese syllable can be mapped\nfrom 3 to over 100 Chinese characters, with the\naverage number of characters per syllable being\n17. According to our computation, the minimum,\nmaximum and average numbers f Chinese words\nper syllable-word in MOE-MANDARIN dic-\ntionary ????????? (one of most com-\nmonly-used Chinese dictionaries published by\nthe Ministry of Education in Taiwan, its online\ndictionary is at (MOE)) are 1, 22 and 1.5, re-\nspectively. Since the size of problem space for\nsyllable-to-word conversion is much less than\nthat of syllable-to-character conversion, the\nmost existing Chinese input systems (Hsu 1994,\nHsu et al 1999, Tsai and Hsu 2002, Gao et al\n2002, MSIME) are addressed on syllable-to-\nword conversion, not syllable-to-character con-\nversion. To the research field of Chinese speech\nrecognition, the STW conversion is the main\ntask of Chinese language processing in typical\nChinese speech recognition systems (Fu et al\n1996, Lee et al 1993, Chien et al 1993, Su et al\n1992).\nConventionally, there are two approaches for\nsyllable-to-word (STW) conversion: (1) the lin-\nguistic approach based on syntax parsing, se-\n"},{"#tail":"\n","@confidence":"0.988781576923077","#text":"\nmantic template matching and contextual infor-\nmation (Hsu 1994, Fu et al 1996, Hsu et al\n1999, Kuo 1995, Tsai and Hsu 2002); and (2)\nthe statistical approach based on the n-gram\nmodels where n is usually 2 or 3 (Lin and Tsai\n1987, Gu et al 1991, Fu et al 1996, Ho et al\n1997, Sproat 1990, Gao et al 2002, Lee 2003).\nAlthough the linguistic approach requires con-\nsiderable effort in designing effective syntax\nrules, semantic templates or contextual informa-\ntion, it is more user-friendly than the statistical\napproach on understanding why such a system\nmakes a mistake (Hsu 1994, Tsai and Hsu 2002).\nOn the other hand, the statistical language model\n(SLM) used in the statistical approach requires\nless effort and has been widely adopted in com-\nmercial Chinese input systems.\nAccording to previous studies (Chung 1993,\nFong and Chung 1994, Tsai and Hsu 2002, Gao\net al 2002, Lee 2003), homophone selection and\nsyllable-word segmentation are two critical\nproblems to the STW conversion in Chinese.\nIncorrect homophone selection and failed sylla-\nble-word segmentation will directly influence\nthe STW conversion rate.

According to previous studies (Chung 1993, Fong and Chung 1994, Tsai and Hsu 2002, Gao et al 2002, Lee 2003), homophone selection and syllable-word segmentation are two critical problems to the STW conversion in Chinese. Incorrect homophone selection and failed syllable-word segmentation will directly influence the STW conversion rate. For example, consider the syllable sequence ?yi1 du4 ji4 yu2 zhong1 guo2 de5 niang4 jiu3 ji4 shu4? of the sentence ???(once)??(covet)??(China)?(of)?? (making-wine)?? (technique).?

For the ambiguous syllable-word section, the set of wordpairs comprised of two multi-syllabic Chinese words (including bi-syllabic words in the following) and their corresponding word-pair frequencies found in the UDN2001 corpus are: {? ?-??(1), ??-??(1), ??-??(4), ??- ??(1), ??-??(1), ??-??(26), ??-? ?(19)}.

As per our analysis, the problems of STW conversion errors can be classified into three major types: (1) Unknown word problem: For any Chinese NLP system, unknown word extraction is one of the most difficult problems and a critical issue (Tsai et al 2003). When an error is caused only by the lack of words in the system dictionary, we call it unknown 13 word problem. (2) Inadequate syllable segmentation problem: When an error is caused by syllable-word overlapping (or say ambiguous syllableword segmentation), instead of an unknown word problem, we call it inadequate syllable segmentation. (3) Homophones problem: These are the remaining STW conversion errors. Table 4.

In practice, therefore, the tonal and toneless STW accuracies could be raised to 98% and 91%, respectively. Although some of unknown words have been incorporated in the system dictionary by a CWCA system (Tsai et al 2004), they could still face the problems: inadequate syllable segmentation and failed homophone disambiguation.
