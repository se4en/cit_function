Indeed, the\nliterature in this field is fragmented: starting in the 1960s and 1970s a sizable literature\non the lexicostatistic properties of language change developed following Swadesh's\nearlier glottochronological studies (for example, Swadesh 1950). On the other hand,\nonly a handful of attempts to produce and evaluate software of the rule-application\ntype (for use in historical linguistics) are documented in the literature (Becker 1982;\nBrandon 1984; Durham & Rogers 1971; Frantz 1970; Kemp 1976).

It measures degree of affiliation using a distance metric based on the degree\nof similarity between corresponding phonemes in different languages. Also to this\nclass belong applications that measure genetic affiliation as a function of the number\nof shared words in a selected vocabulary set. Any method that depends on counting\n&quot;shared words,&quot; we note, assumes the existence and prior application of a means of\ndetermining which forms are cognate; and any such estimates of the relatedness of\nlanguages are only as good as the metric that determines which ones are cognate.\n"},{"#tail":"\n","@confidence":"0.990415166666667","#text":"\napplied to derive later forms from earlier forms, and RE is a member of this class.\nExamples of programs of this sort are PHONO, being applied to Latin-to-Spanish data\n(and described below); VARBRUL (by Susan Pintzuk) used to analyze Old English, and\ntwo programs used to analyze Romance languages: Iberochange, based on a rule-\nprocessing subsystem called BETA, used for lbero-Romance languages (Eastlack 1977)\nand one unnamed (Burton-Hunter 1976).\n"},{"#tail":"\n","@confidence":"0.998234192307692","#text":"\nThe &quot;proto-projection&quot; techniques used by RE were implemented earlier by John\nHewson and others at the Memorial University of Newfoundland (Hewson 1973,\n1974). 5 The strategy is transparent; as Hewson notes, he and his team decided to\n&quot;follow the basic logic used by the linguist in the comparative method&quot; (Hewson\n1974:193). The results of this research ave recently been published in the form of an\netymological dictionary of Proto-Algonkian (Hewson 1993).\nThe program as first envisioned was to operate on &quot;consonant only&quot; transcriptions\nof polysyllabic morphemes from four Amerindian languages. The program would take\na modern form, &quot;project it backwards&quot; into one or more proto-projections, then project\nthese proto-projections i to the next daughter language, deriving the expected regular\nreflexes.

In cases where no reflex could be found\n(as in Figure 5, where no Menomini cognates for this form existed in the database), the\nprocess would grind to a halt. Recognizing that &quot;the end result of such a programme\nwould be almost nil&quot; (Hewson 1973:266), the team developed another approach in\nwhich the program generated all possible proto-projections for the 3,403 modern forms.\nThese 74,049 reconstructions were sorted together, and 'only those that showed identi-\ncal proto-projections i another language' (some 1,305 items) were retained for further\nexamination. At this point Hewson claimed that he and his colleagues were then able\nto quickly identify some 250 new cognate sets (Hewson 1974:195).

This allows RE to reconstruct the form under any of the tones.\nIf this cover symbol were left out, RE would reconstruct this form without a prototone (permitted by\nthe canon), and the form would fail to form a set with other forms that do have the tone specified.\n13 It might be possible to apply the results of some recent research in the area, for example, Wordnet\n(Miller 1990), to part of the problem. Indeed, the &quot;semantic formulas&quot; developed for RE are similar\nstructurally and conceptually to the &quot;synsets&quot; of Wordnet. Ultimately, any solution would have to be\nsensitive not only to synchronic relationships in a single language (like Wordnet) but also to semantic\nshifts (both universal and language-specific) and the possibility of several different glossing\nmetalanguages (in this case both French and English are used).\n"},{"#tail":"\n","@confidence":"0.9507115","#text":"\ntern of &quot;semantic tagging&quot; using a structure we call a &quot;semantic formula.&quot; These are\nbracketed lists of glosses pecifying which glosses are semantically compatible and so\nmight be found glossing reflexes in the same cognate set.

However,\nin RE, as shown below, such rules have quite concrete implications.\nFigure 31b illustrates what a &quot;feature bundle&quot; in RE looks like. To create this rep-\nresentation, the linguist provides a list of features, and specifies the set of constituents\nto which the feature applies (as exemplified in Figure 31a).\nThe feature sets represent a statement of the significant distinctions ineach language;\nwe note in passing that RE thus implements the notion that the phonemes of each\nlanguage pattern in their own way, and that even though the same symbol may be used\nto transcribe words in different languages, this does not necessarily indicate that they\nshare features in common.

The program is a research tool designed to aid the linguist in evaluating specific hypotheses, by calculating the consequences of a set of postulated sound changes (proposed by the linguist) on complete l xicons of several languages. It divides the lexicons into a phonologically regular part and a part that deviates from the sound laws. RE is bi-directionah given words in modern languages, it can propose cognate sets (with reconstructions); given reconstructions, it can project the modern forms that would result from regular changes. RE operates either interactively, allowing word-by-word evaluation of hypothesized sound changes and semantic shifts, or in a &quot;batch&quot; mode, processing entire multilingual exicons en masse. We describe the algorithms implemented in RE, specifically the parsing and combinatorial techniques used to make projections upstream or downstream in the sense of time, the procedures for creating and consolidating cognate sets based on these projections, and the ad hoc techniques developed for handling the semantic omponent of the comparative method. Other programs and computational pproaches tohistorical linguistics are briefly reviewed. Some results from a study of the Tamang languages of Nepal (a subgroup of the Tibeto-Burman family) are presented, and data from these languages are used throughout for exemplification f the operation of the program.

Introduction The essential step in historical reconstruction is the arrangement of related words in different languages into sets of cognates and the specification of the regular phono- logical correspondences that support that arrangement; he well-known means for carrying out this arrangement and specification is the comparative method (see, for example, Meillet 1966; Hoenigswald 1950, 1960; Watkins 1989; Baldi 1990). Words that are not demonstrably related (via regular sound change) are explained by reference to other diachronic processes that are beyond the scope of the comparative method and of this paper. Sound change is first to be explained as a rule-governed process and other explanations (which invoke more sporadic and less predictable processes) * Department of Linguistics, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720.

Introduction The essential step in historical reconstruction is the arrangement of related words in different languages into sets of cognates and the specification of the regular phono- logical correspondences that support that arrangement; he well-known means for carrying out this arrangement and specification is the comparative method (see, for example, Meillet 1966; Hoenigswald 1950, 1960; Watkins 1989; Baldi 1990). Words that are not demonstrably related (via regular sound change) are explained by reference to other diachronic processes that are beyond the scope of the comparative method and of this paper. Sound change is first to be explained as a rule-governed process and other explanations (which invoke more sporadic and less predictable processes) * Department of Linguistics, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720.

There is much room for work here applying techniques already developed in other areas of computational linguistics. We have occasionally been asked why we have not developed software that would create tables of correspondences based on universal or at least subgroup-wide phono- logical principles of analysis and comparison. Such an algorithm has already been proposed by Martin Kay (Kay 1964). Our research as focused on evaluating existing hypotheses rather than the process of creating new ones. There is indeed much work that could be done here and we hope that the burgeoning interest in computational historical inguistics will lead to the investigation of this question.

Indeed, the literature in this field is fragmented: starting in the 1960s and 1970s a sizable literature on the lexicostatistic properties of language change developed following Swadesh's earlier glottochronological studies (for example, Swadesh 1950). On the other hand, only a handful of attempts to produce and evaluate software of the rule-application type (for use in historical linguistics) are documented in the literature (Becker 1982; Brandon 1984; Durham & Rogers 1971; Frantz 1970; Kemp 1976). In general these programs eem to have been abandoned after a certain amount of experimentation. Certainly the problem of articulating a set of algorithms and associated data sets that completely describe the regular sound changes evidenced by a group of languages i a daunting task. To the first class belong lexicostatistic models of language change. The COMPASS module of the WORDSURV program described below belongs to this class (cf. Wimbish 1989).

Introduction The essential step in historical reconstruction is the arrangement of related words in different languages into sets of cognates and the specification of the regular phono- logical correspondences that support that arrangement; he well-known means for carrying out this arrangement and specification is the comparative method (see, for example, Meillet 1966; Hoenigswald 1950, 1960; Watkins 1989; Baldi 1990). Words that are not demonstrably related (via regular sound change) are explained by reference to other diachronic processes that are beyond the scope of the comparative method and of this paper. Sound change is first to be explained as a rule-governed process and other explanations (which invoke more sporadic and less predictable processes) * Department of Linguistics, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720.

This allows RE to reconstruct the form under any of the tones. If this cover symbol were left out, RE would reconstruct this form without a prototone (permitted by the canon), and the form would fail to form a set with other forms that do have the tone specified. 13 It might be possible to apply the results of some recent research in the area, for example, Wordnet (Miller 1990), to part of the problem. Indeed, the &quot;semantic formulas&quot; developed for RE are similar structurally and conceptually to the &quot;synsets&quot; of Wordnet. Ultimately, any solution would have to be sensitive not only to synchronic relationships in a single language (like Wordnet) but also to semantic shifts (both universal and language-specific) and the possibility of several different glossing metalanguages (in this case both French and English are used). 406 Lowe and Mazaudon The Reconstruction E gine *Ab e/3.138.19. mar 3pe wife pra 3pic wife syang 3pe wife tuk 3pe wife *Ab e :/3.138.20. *Ab ? t/3.13","@endWordPosition":"10630","@position":"65360","annotationId":"T25","@startWordPosition":"10629","@citStr":"Miller 1990"}},"title":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"ed. &quot;Wordnet: an on-line lexical database.&quot;"},"@valid":"true","authors":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"\n","author":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"G A Miller"}}},{"volume":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"3"},"#tail":"\n","date":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"1993"},"rawString":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"Ralston, Anthony, and Reilly, Edwin D.

The programs discussed by no means exhaust the field; the criteria for selecting them is that they have been described in the literature sufficiently for an evaluation, and that for this reason they have come to the attention of the authors. Indeed, the literature in this field is fragmented: starting in the 1960s and 1970s a sizable literature on the lexicostatistic properties of language change developed following Swadesh's earlier glottochronological studies (for example, Swadesh 1950).

Also to this class belong applications that measure genetic affiliation as a function of the number of shared words in a selected vocabulary set. Any method that depends on counting &quot;shared words,&quot; we note, assumes the existence and prior application of a means of determining which forms are cognate; and any such estimates of the relatedness of languages are only as good as the metric that determines which ones are cognate. 387 Computational Lingu","@endWordPosition":"2873","@position":"18700","annotationId":"T31","@startWordPosition":"2872","@citStr":"Wimbish 1989"},{"#tail":"\n","#text":"uists to compare and analyze word lists from different languages and to perform phonostatistic analysis.
