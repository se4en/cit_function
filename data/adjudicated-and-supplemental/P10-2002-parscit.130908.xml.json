CFSM is used to capture how likely the sourceside rule is linguistically motivated or has the corresponding target-side counterpart. For CBSM, it can be naturally viewed as a classification problem where each distinct source-side rule is a single class. However, considering the huge number of classes may cause serious data sparseness problem and thereby degrade the classification accuracy, we approximate CBSM by a binary classification problem which can be solved by the maximum entropy (ME) approach (Berger et al., 1996) as follows: P3(α|C) P3(v|α, C) exp[Ei Aihi(v, α, C)] (4) EV/ exp[Ei Aihi(v�, α, C)] where v E 10, 11 is the indicator whether the source-side rule is applied during decoding, v = 1 when the source-side rule is applied, otherwise v = 0; hi is a feature function, Ai is the weight of hi. CBSM estimates the probability of the source-side rule being selected according to the rich context information coming from the surface strings and sub-phrases that will be reduced to non-terminals during decoding. Analogously, we decompose the target-side rule selection model by the interpolation approach as we","@endWordPosition":"1050","@position":"6736","annotationId":"T1","@startWordPosition":"1047","@citStr":"Berger et al., 1996"}},"title":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"A Maximum Entropy Approach to Natural Language Processing."},"volume":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"22"},"#tail":"\n","rawString":{"#tail":"\n","#text":"Adam L.

Extending this work, (He et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2008) integrate rich context information of non-terminals to predict the target-side rule selection. Different from the above work where the probability distribution of source-side rule selection is uniform, (Setiawan et al., 2009) proposes to select sourceside rules based on the captured function words which often play an important role in word reordering. There is also some work considering to involve more rich contexts to guide the source-side rule selection. (Marton and Resnik, 2008; Xiong et al., 2009) explore the source syntactic information to reward exact matching structure rules or punish crossing structure rules. All the previous work mainly focused on either source-side rule selection task or target-side rule selection task rather than both of them together. The separation of these two tasks, however, weakens the high interrelation between them. In this paper, we propose to integrate both source-side and target-side rule selection in a unified model. The intuition is that the joint selection of source-side and target-side rules is more reliable as it conducts the ","@endWordPosition":"475","@position":"3103","annotationId":"T3","@startWordPosition":"472","@citStr":"Marton and Resnik, 2008"},{"#tail":"\n","#text":"nd choke the training procedure.

We compare our method with the baseline and some typical approaches listed in Table 1 where XP+ denotes the approach in (Marton and Resnik, 2008) and TOFW (topological ordering of function words) stands for the method in (Setiawan et al., 2009). As (Xiong et al., 2009)\u2019s work is based on phrasal SMT system with bracketing transduction grammar rules (Wu, 1997) and (Shen et al., 2009)\u2019s work is based on the string-to-dependency SMT model, we do not implement these two related work due to their different models from ours. We also do not compare with (He et al., 2008)\u2019s work due to its less practicability of integrating numerous sub-models.
